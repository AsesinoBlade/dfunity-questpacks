<ce>							[MAIN QUEST]
<ce>
<ce>                You're trying to track down that letter
<ce>               of the Emperor's, yes? There are very few
<ce>               scandals in the Bay of which I am totally
<ce>             ignorant. I could give you some information,
<ce>              but nothing is without a price, that I know
<ce>               well. I need a champion who doesn't fear the
<ce>                 fire of Oblivion. Are you interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>              Pity. I will find someone else to help me.
<ce>             But who will you find to help you, I wonder.
<ce>   
<ce>   [NOTE: you have rejected a required segment of the main quest.
<ce>   You must reload a save file or persist in the doomed world
<ce>   you have created.]

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               %oth, that is a relief to me. Do not ask
<ce>             any questions -- get this letter to a certain
<ce>               high level sorcerer at the Necromancers'
<ce>                crypt, Scourg Barrow in the Dragontail
<ce>               Mountains. Avoid the rift. If you see it,
<ce>                        you have gone too far.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                  They will not be expecting you and
<ce>               will not wait for any introductions. The
<ce>               necromancers feel that death is a reward
<ce>              for the living, not a punishment. Once you
<ce>              have delivered the letter, they would feel
<ce>                no need to guarantee your safety. It is
<ce>                their way. I need the letter delivered
<ce>                     and a response from _necs_.
<ce>                        The risks are very high,
<ce>                       %pcf, please do not fail.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    I need a response to my letter
<ce>                          from _necs_, %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                It's done! I'll be queen of Firsthold!
<ce>            Although I'm sure the _engagementletter_ will be quite
<ce>            lengthy. Now, I promised you information about
<ce>                         the Emperor's letter.
<ce>                                    
<ce>            The letter you seek is in the hands of Gortwog,
<ce>            the Warlord of the Orcs. He bought it from the
<ce>            Thieves Guild of Daggerfall after one of their
<ce>                  number stole it from Queen Aubk-i.
<ce>                                    
<ce>            I confess I don't know why the Emperor sent it
<ce>            to Aubk-i. The girl is innocent to a fault, and
<ce>             everyone knows that Gothryd is not the loyal
<ce>           empire toady that Lysandus was. Of course my own
<ce>           family...well enough of this boring court gossip.
<ce>                                    
<ce>              If you really want to find this letter, you
<ce>             should get in good with Mynisera, the former
<ce>               Queen of Daggerfall, and Queen Mother to
<ce>              Gothryd. I wouldn't directly approach her.
<ce>                 Start with someone of lower station.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
If it weren't for Morgiah's reputation, Wayrest would embrace her brother.
<--->
How could we crown the brother of a manipulative witch like Princess Morgiah?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Princess Morgiah's mood has worsened. And no one has as bad a temper as she.
<--->
I suppose it is time that Princess Morgiah married. But who would want her?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Princess Morgiah is engaged to the King of Firsthold. A miracle of %god indeed.
<--->
What could've possessed the King of Firsthold to propose marriage to Morgiah?
<--->
Morgiah has a three year _engagementletter_! Royals are a strange lot.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  You've failed me, %pcf. I required an answer from _necs_ within one month.
<ce>                  Now you dare return to me so late? Begone!

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
_necs_,
<ce>                                    
<ce>                I agree to your terms. I will give you
<ce>              my first and you will exert your influence
<ce>              on the King of Firsthold on Sumerset Isle.
<ce>               Only you can let him speak with his dead
<ce>              son. For that, he would even marry Nulfaga!
<ce>

Princess,
<ce>                                    
 Done.

[MAIN QUEST]
<ce>
 Princess Morgiah of Wayrest has
 asked me to deliver a letter to the
 _necs_ of the Necromancers
 of Scourg Barrow in the Dragontail
 Mountains. She said to avoid the rift,
 whatever that is. If I see it, I have
 gone too far. She wants a reply back
 in a month.

Message:  1013
Princess Morgiah has left Wayrest for Summerset Isle and the King of Firsthold.
<--->
Wayrest has cemented relations with the High Elves of Firsthold by marriage.
<--->
Firsthold has a new queen, and Wayrest has lost a princess.
<--->
Morgiah will be happy being Karoodil's queen in Firsthold.
<--->
Morgiah will be the first queen of Firsthold who isn't a High Elf.

<ce>           A young lad with the Rose of Wayrest embroidered
<ce>           on his surcoat appears at your side, hands you an
<ce>                    engraved card, and disappears.

Message:  1016
<ce>                  Very good. If you are not rewarded
<ce>                   with death by the loyal servants
<ce>                   of the Barrow, give this note to
<ce>                       Princess Morgiah please.
