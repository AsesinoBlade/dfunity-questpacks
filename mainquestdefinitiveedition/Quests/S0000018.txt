<ce>              So Medora wants the Dust of Restful Death.
<ce>               Only because I respect the memory of King
<ce>                Lysandus will I do this. The Dust can be
<ce>                       found in ___crypt_ on her
<ce>               own island. Tell Medora that the price is
<ce>                 her support of my claim to the heart.
<ce>                       She'll know what it means.

 Medora came to me in a vision and told me
 that Lysandus ghost could be soothed if I
 can convince Gortwog, Lord of the Orcs in
 Orsinium, to tell me where it is.

%qdt:
 I have spoken with Gortwog. He claims that
 the Dust of Restful Death can be found in
 ___crypt_ on the Isle of
 Balfiera. He also instructed me to tell
 Medora that she must support his claim to
 the heart of Tiber Septim, whatever that is.

<ce>                 Your vision hazes and the world grows
<ce>                  dim. Out of the gray, a woman's face
<ce>                            appears. Medora!
<ce>                                    
 "%pcf. Your efforts to free me
 have not been in vain. I have discovered
 a powder that will soothe the ghost of
 my beloved Lysandus. However, it is in the
 hands of Gortwog, Warlord of the Orcs, in
 his steel citadel of Orsinium. Go to him
 in Orsinium and see if there is anything
 that can be done to persuade him to give
 it to you. Bring the powder to me in
 Direnni Tower once you have it."
<ce>                                    
<ce>                 The vision clears. Sometimes you wish
<ce>                sorceresses would just send letters like
<ce>                            other folks do.

A packet of midnight black powder.

<ce>               This parchment was used as a wrap for the
<ce>                packet of powder. Some of its message is
<ce>                             now illegible.

 ...favor. They intend to slay him. I am
 sending ........ers to stop them. You must
 support me. If the empire finds I have
 attacked royal advisors of Wayr......ven
 if they are assassins, my people will never
 win the same status and respect as the
 Khaji................ians. However, with
 your support I c............. a hero of the
 empire, and win respect for my people.

This is indeed the Dust of Restful Death.
 As for that letter, it was from Gortwog
 to me, though I never got it. I heard from
 him later that his orc warriors were slain
 attempting to ambush the assassins. Gortwog
 and his orcs are not the villains most
 people see them as.
 
 Eadwyre and the court of Wayrest have never
 been particularly loyal to the empire. To
 assassinate a king is treason. I will have
 my revenge, but first I must find out why
 Eadwyre would risk this.
 
 Give me a moment to prepare the Dust.
