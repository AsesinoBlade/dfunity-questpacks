<ce>                DFU INNKEEPER AND MERCHANT QUEST
<ce>          
<ce>           My name is _questgiver_. I appear to have been involved
<ce>          in something of a scam, %ra, and anonymous threats have
<ce>           appeared outside my door for several days. I need you to
<ce>          take this _item_ to _tavern_ in
<ce>          ___tavern_. There you will find the true thief
<ce>           of it, who has promised to clear my name after 
<ce>            buying it back. Will you do this to save my
<ce>              reputation and possibly my life?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>          Then begone. You waste my time.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                Very good, quickly now. Head to
<ce>            ___tavern_. I need you to be there
<ce>             as soon as possible. You'll get your
<ce>            reward from the thief when you
<ce>             hand the _item_ over. Be moving
<ce>            quickly now, %ra. Have it done in
<ce>            fewer than =timer_ days.

<ce>           Your reputation is now free from the stain
<ce>          _questgiver_ attempted to impose on it.
<ce>           The _item_ will be a souvenir of %g3 antics.

Message:  1020
<ce>               As soon as you enter with the
<ce>               _item_, you hear shouting
<ce>                 from within the tavern.
<ce>            
<ce>                "Your thieving days are
<ce>                  over, %ra! Now die!"
<ce>            
<ce>         It appears this was some kind of ambush.

 _questgiver_ in the town of
 ___questgiver_ gave me a
 stolen _item_ that needs to
 get to ___tavern_

 me a reward.

Message:  1031
