 It's finished. I have everything I need.
 I merely need to go to Castle Llugwych in
 ____llug_, find "it" there, and decide who it's
 going to.

<ce>           This is it. It's undeniable. Touching it undoes
<ce>              the invisibility enchantment placed on it.
<ce>         As your hands graze it, you feel a mental connection
<ce>              to the massive, cold body of the Numidium,
<ce>               buried deep within the Isle of Balfiera.
<ce>                It has no ability to move as yet, but
<ce>          the potential is there. Your mind starts to race.
<ce>
<ce>            With the Totem in your hands, you must decide.
<ce>         Only one will win in the end, and you know you won't
<ce>        survive long enough to gain Numidium's power yourself.
<ce>         Control has to go to someone. The question is, who?
