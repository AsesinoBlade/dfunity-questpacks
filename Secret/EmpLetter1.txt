Message:  1010
<ce>  A tall messenger, bearing the banner
<ce>  of the Imperial City, gives you a letter.

Message:  1011
<ce>  To my friend %pcn
<ce>  Last known region: ____here_
<ce>  
<ce>  Message dictated to High Chancellor Ocato
<ce>  
<ce>  My good friend, how are you doing?
<ce>  Feel no hurry to respond to my message.
<ce>  I am certain you have many important
<ce>  things on your mind, and I do not wish to
<ce>  take from your time.
<ce>  
<ce>  It appears my simple mission for you has become
<ce>  much more complex. I nevertheless believe I have
<ce>  sent the right person. There will be no replacement
<ce>  for you. I trust you wholeheartedly, and hope for
<ce>  the same from you.
<ce>  
<ce>  I'm aware you lost, sold, or somehow misplaced your
<ce>  imperial seal. In other cases I would call for censure,
<ce>  but I am certain you did things with the proper judgment.
<ce>  One day you will tell me the story, and I will understand.
<ce>  
<ce>  I agree with your decision to trust in Popudax.
<ce>  Were the noble Lysandus still alive he would be
<ce>  my counselor in all things, but his court
<ce>  wizard makes a fine replacement.
<ce>  
<ce>  Many will try to bribe you and sway your judgment.
<ce>  I have sent you to a land of soft words and flattery.
<ce>  Remember that the nicer the appearance, the less
<ce>  likely they speak with sincerity.
<ce>  
<ce>  Now that the word concerning Numidium is out, the
<ce>  whole land will move to recover it. I trust in you,
<ce>  both to survive in these wild times and to return
<ce>  its power to me. As Tiber Septim's descendant,
<ce>  carrying his legacy, I will protect the Empire
<ce>  he gave his life to create. All people will be
<ce>  safe under my command. You know this perfectly well.
<ce>  
<ce>  I look forward to hearing more of your adventures,
<ce>  my confidant.
<ce>  
<ce>  The Divines be on your side
<ce>  Uriel Septim VII
