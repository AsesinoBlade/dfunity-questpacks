<ce>   You kneel before King Eadwyre and beseech him to open the
<ce>   contents of the bag. At first amused, he smirks and asks a
<ce>   servant to do it for him. Faces turn pale in the throne room
<ce>   as they realize its contents and the evidence of orcs.
<ce>   
<ce>   Eadwyre, consumed by rage, nearly orders your execution
<ce>   before Barenziah demands moderation. You repeat the tale
<ce>   told to you by the Redguard. The King calls his closest
<ce>   advisors to him and begins shouting at them.
<ce>   
<ce>   "By the blood of my ancestors, the orcs will pay!
<ce>   They will bleed! They will suffer! I will not rest until
<ce>   Orsinium itself is reduced to ASHES!" He then points at you.
<ce>   "And you, foul messenger, LEAVE AT ONCE!" His court nervously
<ce>   hurries you along. It appears Wayrest Castle will not look
<ce>   forward to any future visits of yours.

<ce>   "Forgive me, my good %ra, let me just finish this
<ce>   business and I will be happy to attend to you."
<ce>   
<ce>   This man is in the process of tearing up a parchment.
<ce>   In the dim light you barely see the Emperor's seal
<ce>   before his fingers pull it apart. This was the letter
<ce>   you were sent to find!
<ce>  
<ce>  "Now then, I have committed to memory the contents
<ce>  of the letter, and would be happy to repeat them to you
<ce>  for a small price. I'm sorry that I have to do this, but
<ce>  I simply must demand your help in a trifling matter.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I represent the one true heir of the Emperor's power,
<ce>  and will speedily aid you in resolving Uriel Septim's
<ce>  errand if you will side with me. I swear it on my Redguard honor.
<ce>  All I need is a simple war between Orsinium and Wayrest,
<ce>  instigated by your hand. I have here in this bag the remains of
<ce>  Eadwyre's niece, along with clear evidence of Orcish involvement.
<ce>  Deliver it to him and say Gortwog left it outside the gates of
<ce>  Wayrest. All else should roll along smoothly from there."

<ce>   (ORCISH SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>  
<ce>  As the stranger ceases speaking, you hear Orcish grunting
<ce>  behind you. It appears you've been followed. A small
<ce>  detachment of two orcs and a shaman maintain a short distance
<ce>  from you. They shout at you, urging some kind of action,
<ce>  but they are clearly not hostile. You simply don't understand
<ce>  what they want to tell you.
<ce>  
<ce>  The Redguard scowls at the sight of the orcs. His hand
<ce>  lights up with a fire spell, ready to scorch the
<ce>  remaining fragments of the letter.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Restore a burnt parchment? Impossible! Don't be a fool,
<ce>  agent! Help me slay them and then deliver this bag to
<ce>  Eadwyre! It's your only hope of serving the Emperor!"
<ce>  
<ce>  You must make a decision. Do you side with
<ce>  the Redguard (yes) or with the orcs (no)?

<ce>   (ORCISH SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>  
<ce>  As the stranger ceases speaking, you hear Orcish grunting
<ce>  behind you. It appears you've been followed. A small
<ce>  detachment of two orcs and a shaman maintain a short distance
<ce>  from you.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Do not trust this man, %ra. He will not keep his word!
<ce>  He is with the Underking, enemy of all mankind!
<ce>  Help us slay him and we will restore the letter he
<ce>  holds in his hands. We will read it together!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The Redguard scowls at the sight of the orcs. His hand
<ce>  lights up with a fire spell, ready to scorch the
<ce>  remaining fragments of the letter.
<ce>

<ce>  The man throws the bag at you before anyone can
<ce>  react. He casts a spell to teleport away, but not
<ce>  before invoking a pair of atronachs to help you
<ce>  in the fight.

Message:  1014
<ce>  With a moment to yourself, you notice a note is pinned
<ce>  to the outside of the bag, which you detach.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Once I hear of a new war, I will send word for you."
<ce>  
<ce>  This appears to be your only way forward.

Message:  1015
<ce>  As you leave the castle, you hear troops being ordered into
<ce>  regiments. Eadwyre suffers no hesitation in ordering the
<ce>  war against Orsinium. For better or for worse, things
<ce>  are now irretrievably in motion.

Message:  1016
<ce>  The man's face contorts in a rage, but before he can
<ce>  react, the shaman responds with a silence spell.
<ce>  The Redguard's face turns pale. He can no longer
<ce>  destroy the parchment with fire or use whatever
<ce>  escape method he had planned. The orcs descend on him
<ce>  before he can harm the letter any more.

Message:  1017
<ce>  You quickly grab the letter scraps from the dead man's
<ce>  hands. However, the orcs surround you and request that
<ce>  you give them over. The shaman then places them on the
<ce>  floor and attempts a few spells. To your surprise,
<ce>  the pieces begin to rearrange themselves!
<ce>  Not all the harm can be reversed, but you're able
<ce>  to read most of the contents.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Deares... a calamity i...on us.
<ce>  The Numi...is outside Direnni Tower. Secure the Tot...
<ce>  Guard it with you...ife. If ...ll possible,
<ce>  capture Diren...er itself or e... the whole Isle of
<ce>  Balfiera. Even Oblivion cannot do us such harm
<ce>  as could this monstro..."
<ce>  
<ce>  One of the orcs, even without knowing the common tongue,
<ce>  memorized the written words. The shaman invokes invisibility
<ce>  on them all, and the troupe then makes haste
<ce>  to deliver the sayings to Gortwog, who will know how to
<ce>  understand them. They don't need the letter.
<ce>  At the very least, you can deliver what remains to Aubk-i.
<ce>  If the orcs know its contents, destroying it now would
<ce>  only put you at a disadvantage.
