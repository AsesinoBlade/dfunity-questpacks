Message:  1010
<ce>  A messenger wearing the Empire's crest
<ce>  gives you a letter, and bows deeply
<ce>  before departing in silence.

Message:  1011
<ce>  %pcn,
<ce>  
<ce>  You are a hero to the Empire. I sent you
<ce>  for a trifling matter, and you persevered
<ce>  as it grew into something much larger.
<ce>  I was not wrong to send you, but I never
<ce>  could have imagined how right I truly was!
<ce>  We shall expend the full forces of the
<ce>  Imperial City to keep the Totem safe.
<ce>  Once Numidium's heart returns, we shall
<ce>  re-establish order in the Iliac Bay and
<ce>  give peace to all its troubled people.
<ce>  
<ce>  With an unending gratitude,
<ce>  Your friend forever, in life and death,
<ce>  Past, present and future,
<ce>  Uriel Septim VII, Emperor of Tamriel
