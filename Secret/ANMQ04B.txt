 My visit with Medora was worth the trip.
 She said I can find a tool to locate the
 Totem in the dungeons under Sentinel Palace.
 She also said she doesn't care who gets
 the Totem, and when I've delivered it,
 I need to return to her to talk about the
 power source for Numidium.

<ce>                "Hmm? Identify yourself or be slain."
<ce>
<ce>           You cautiously explain that the Emperor has sent
<ce>              you to find the power to control Numidium,
<ce>                 and that you intend no one any harm.
<ce>                She hesitates, and then casts a spell
<ce>                      that makes your head hurt.
<ce>
<ce>       "Maybe I'm a fool. Or maybe I just don't care anymore."
<ce>
<ce>           She releases the spell on you. Just as you start
<ce>                  to fear for her mental stability,
<ce>                     the woman lowers her hands.
<ce>
<ce>           "The only man worthy to direct Numidium in this
<ce>           bleak age was my beloved Lysandus. His heart was
<ce>           perfect. He would never harm a soul. Now that he
<ce>         is dead... What do I care for this wretched sphere?
<ce>
<ce>           "I've read your memories and know your purpose.
<ce>         If you have a mind to unleash Numidium on the world,
<ce>         I care nothing for its destruction. The machine was
<ce>         created with a few rules, one of them being to never
<ce>           harm this tower. I can watch the world burn from
<ce>        my own roof. Perhaps... that is what I truly wait for.
<ce>
<ce>            "The location of the Totem, I cannot tell you.
<ce>         But a tool was created ages ago that can reveal it.
<ce>          Unbeknownst to them, the royal family of Sentinel
<ce>        holds this tool in their vaults. Search for it in the
<ce>           most guarded place. It will show you how to find
<ce>           the Totem and undo its invisibility enchantment.
<ce>
<ce>          "Still, you don't know what the Totem looks like.
<ce>                This is it." She casts a short spell,
<ce>              and your mind is flooded with the image of
<ce>             a small, oval statue in the shape of a baby.
<ce>           "You'll need to know that when the time comes."
<ce>
<ce>            "As you consulted with those friends of yours,
<ce>            you can't hold on to the Totem for very long,
<ce>             for others will slay you. Work out your plan
<ce>              for how you're going to deliver it to the
<ce>               right person, whoever that is. When your
<ce>              plan is ready, come to me at the very end.
<ce>                   I will tell you about Numidium's
<ce>               power source, and we will begin the end
<ce>                        of Tamriel together."

<ce>                  Somewhere underneath this castle,
<ce>               in "the most guarded place," a tool will
<ce>                    show you the Totem's location.

<ce>              You're surprised to find a telescope here.
<ce>               A small sign hangs off of it: "Useless."
<ce>                   Apparently it was consigned here
<ce>                once the royal family couldn't find a
<ce>            use for it. Nevertheless, the bill of purchase
<ce>             you find inside it represents too much money
<ce>                        to simply throw away.
<ce>
<ce>              You look through the telescope and can see
<ce>                   a castle, far away in a forest.
<ce>            You zoom the lens out as much as possible and
<ce>           see a coast to the north. You gain your bearings
<ce>            with some nearby villages and generally orient
<ce>              the location in the region of Ykalon. Then
<ce>            you zoom in for more detail and see the words,
<ce>                          "Castle Llugwych."
<ce>
<ce>            Try as you might, you can't look at any other
<ce>         destination with the telescope. No amount of turning
<ce>          leads anywhere else. If Lady Direnni spoke right,
<ce>                   this has to be the right place.
<ce>
<ce>           Last of all, you find a small button on the base
<ce>          of the telescope. You press it and an enchantment
<ce>         shoots forth onto your body. If you needed some way
<ce>            to see through the Totem's invisibility spell,
<ce>                         you hope this is it.
