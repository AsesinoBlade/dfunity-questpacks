Message:  1011
<ce>              An extravagantly-dressed courier with the
<ce>           crest of Wayrest appears with a letter for you.

Message:  1012
<ce>              A small troupe from Daggerfall deliver you
<ce>                     a letter and then turn away.

Message:  1013
<ce>                 An Orcish shaman with a solemn face
<ce>                 gives you a missive and walks away.

Message:  1014
<ce>           A sparrow drops a letter on the ground near you.
<ce>           You recognize the coded writing as Charvek-si's.

Message:  1015

<ce>                             and departs.

Message:  1016
<ce>            A lurching, decrepit body shambles toward you

Message:  1017
<ce>                 A group of Sentinel's royal soldiers

I will be quick. In the vaults of Wayrest I have
stored the Warlock's Ring and the Staff
of Magnus. If you find and give me the Totem,
they are yours. You will also earn the
everlasting esteem of the Court of Wayrest.

Message:  1022
To %pcn, Imperial Agent
<ce>
Please consider granting the power of the Totem
to Daggerfall. I know we have not spoken much
due to my duties as king. I beg you, do not
misunderstand me. I am fully prepared to
grant you two legendary artifacts, the
Necromancer's Amulet and the Lord's Mail,
if you can somehow deliver the Totem
into my hands. I swear it before any
witnesses you choose. You will also become
a hero among all my people.

Message:  1023
Honorable %pcn
<ce>
We are two creatures of honor, you and I.
All my commitments, I will keep. If you
will grant me the Totem, I swear as follows:
<ce>
I will establish Orsinium as a safe land
for the people of the orcs.
<ce>
I will protect my people and never attack
the Bretons or the Redguards, save
for self-defense.
<ce>
I will leave the lands of all humans alone,
except half the Wrothgarian Mountains which
I shall claim for our home. I will make all
efforts to expulse the denizens by peaceful means.
<ce>
Numidium shall be the everlasting possession
of the orcs, never to be sold or gifted, or
used for aggression in any war.
<ce>
I have so sworn it.
<ce>
If you will ignore my plea, my people will die,
so sure as the sun will set.
<ce>
Gortwog, Lord of the Orcs

Message:  1024
                              %pcf,
<ce>
Do you remember what I told you about the
Underking? Please consider the future of
Tamriel. I understand now why the Underking
still exists. Numidium requires his heart,
heavily enchanted, as a power source.
The Underking needs his heart to die. He struggles
on as a half-entity, year after year, unable to stop
existing. Let him, and let Numidium die
with him. This is the only way to
prevent catastrophe. Please, hear me.
I've included a map of Cyrodiil and the
place where the Underking's servants
congregate. If you can get it there,
it will be safe from everyone; it will be
Tamriel's best-kept secret.

Message:  1025
To my friend %pcn
Last known region: ____here_
<ce>
Message dictated to High Chancellor Ocato
<ce>
Your progress has been most satisfactory,
my champion. You must not tarry. Wars
already begin to break out among the
people of the Iliac Bay. Please,
find some way to deliver me the Totem
as quickly as possible. I will restore order
and ensure the Empire's peace remains
upon all these innocent people
at risk of the monarchs' wrath.

The Divines protect you

Message:  1026
%pcn
<ce>
Not far from discovering the Totem, are you?
You are wise to mistrust the craven mortals.
We both know ruin will come to this land should
you give Numidium's power to any of them.
<ce>
I will not awaken Numidium at all. The machine is
powered by a divine, magical heart. I will consume
that heart and with its power move on to a new dimension,
leaving all these cares behind. The brass golem
need never rise at all.
<ce>
In return, I would be happy to give you some power
in the dark arts. You will not be disappointed
with what I share!

Message:  1027
                             To %pcn
<ce>
          150,000 gold coins. I have emptied my vaults,
         liquidated my ship, and sold every loose object
          in my house that I could without arousing the
          fear of the peasantry. All of it, and endless fame
             among the people of Sentinel, are yours
          if you bring me the Totem. Buy a ship and free
         yourself of the troubles of Tamriel. Profit and
           live your own life. Or purchase a house here
           in Sentinel. We will welcome you as our own.
<ce>
            The people of Sentinel will guard Numidium
            as our own, and it will defend our lands.
           We will never fear invasion again, nor will
              we strike against any nation with it.
            All lands will be at peace if the machine
                         is given to us.
<ce>
                            So sworn,
                      Queen Aubk-i, Sentinel
