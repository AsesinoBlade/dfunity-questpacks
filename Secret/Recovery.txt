<ce>   

Message:  1010
<ce>  As the Emperor originally intended, you show the
<ce>  letter to the Queen of Daggerfall. The rest of the
<ce>  court crowds around, squinting to see it as best
<ce>  they can. They begin to murmur about its meaning.
<ce>  
<ce>  Aubk-i, clearly out of her depth, tries to
<ce>  speak with some authority. "I insist you show
<ce>  this parchment to the court sorcerer, Popudax.
<ce>  His quarters are right over there, along the
<ce>  west wall. If anyone will know concerning
<ce>  this calamity, he it shall be.
<ce>  
<ce>  "The rest of you, maintain silence. We trust that
<ce>  a single word shall not leave this castle."
<ce>  The court patrons bow before her.

Message:  1011
<ce>  "Hello there. How can I help you?"
<ce>  
<ce>  You show the damaged letter and the place where
<ce>  the Emperor's seal was before being torn up,
<ce>  and explain the events to this point.
<ce>  He takes a sharp glass to peer through, then
<ce>  casts a few spells. After several tests, he
<ce>  seems satisfied. Then he begins to speak in a whisper.
<ce>  A field of silence surrounds the two of you, apparently
<ce>  one of the spells he included while reading.
<ce>  
<ce>  "My dear %ra, we are all in grave danger.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Very few people know, or knew, the existence
<ce>  of this thing until now. It was presumed destroyed
<ce>  after Tiber Septim used it to dominate this continent
<ce>  and create the now-existing Empire. They called it Numidium, 
<ce>  a metal machine hundreds of meters tall that would obey
<ce>  its master's voice like a dog. 'Destroy Elsweyr,' you
<ce>  could say, and it would rush to the genocide.
<ce>  Such power is horrifying. Whether Tiber Septim
<ce>  used it for good or evil is beyond us at this point.
<ce>  Who can be trusted with such power in this age of war?
<ce>  If no opponent could ever resist you, where would you stop?
<ce>  
<ce>  "When you spoke to the queen, did you notice the diplomats
<ce>  from Sentinel and Wayrest in the audience? Lord Provlith, 
<ce>  for instance? I cannot doubt he is already sending word
<ce>  to Queen Akorithi by the fastest boat. It cannot be helped.
<ce>  The great powers of High Rock and Hammerfell will
<ce>  now race to gain it for themselves. For the owner of
<ce>  Numidium, no conquest will ever be impossible,
<ce>  even if the united Empire rallied against.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Now, why are we surrounded by a field of silence
<ce>  instead of discussing this with the royal family?
<ce>  Because they are as much a danger as Gortwog or
<ce>  the very Underking. Aubk-i is a little girl, and
<ce>  Gothryd loves only himself. I served his father,
<ce>  and cannot in good conscience help this king gain
<ce>  any more power than he has got. I know the difference.
<ce>  Lysandus would have done the right thing. Gothryd
<ce>  is incapable of it.
<ce>  
<ce>  "The spell enveloping us will soon end. I will
<ce>  share with you a few last words. We now know Numidium's
<ce>  location, but not what the 'Totem' is, which is used
<ce>  to control Numidium, nor Numidium's power source.
<ce>  Once they are located, the world will be in an uproar.
<ce>  Know who to trust. Watch people carefully.
<ce>  Numidium must end in the hands of someone. As the
<ce>  Emperor's agent, it is your duty to help whoever will
<ce>  save or spare the people. The future of Tamriel is before you."
<ce>  
<ce>  The spell wavers, and soon the uncomfortable vacuum of noise
<ce>  unravels around you. Popudax tries his best to fake a smile.
<ce>  
<ce>  "If you have questions or get stuck at any point,
<ce>  come see me. No matter your choices, I will do my best
<ce>  to aid you, no questions asked."

Message:  1012
<ce>  Popudax writes something on a piece of paper and
<ce>  discreetly puts it in your hand when no one else
<ce>  is watching. He then bids you farewell and returns
<ce>  to his work, trying to calm himself.

Message:  1013
<ce>  Seek out Charvek-si of Wayrest and Br'itsa of Lainlyn.
<ce>  They hold great power. I trust them.
