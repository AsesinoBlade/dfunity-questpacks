Lord Woodborne's dead, and Wayrest is better for it.
<--->
Lord Woodborne was killed by unknown forces.

Message:  1010
<ce>                    "Letter for %pcn! Hello there!
<ce>                  Is that you? Gotta go, take this!"
<ce>
<ce>                A courier atop a horse shoves a stack
<ce>         of parchment into your hands and rides off swiftly.
<ce>           You look at the papers and find them blank, but
<ce>               tucked within there's a glowing object.
<ce>                You fail to drop it quickly enough...

Message:  1011
<ce>                    "Finally. Get ready, you two."
<ce>
<ce>         Your eyes adjust to the darkness and find a warrior
<ce>             before you who you don't recognize. You have
<ce>                      no time for introductions.
<ce>
<ce>              "Well, %pcf, I'm glad to finally meet you.
<ce>               You're quite hard to corner, aren't you?
<ce>           Like the rat you are, scurrying every which way
<ce>                          to ruin my plans.
<ce>
<ce>         "I am Lord Woodborne, and I am the rightful heir of
<ce>             the Numidium, precisely as it is written in
<ce>            the Elder Scrolls. It is my destiny to take up
<ce>              Tiber Septim's mantle, build a new empire
<ce>               in the wake of Uriel's failure to lead,
<ce>            and crush every one of my foes across Tamriel.
<ce>
<ce>          "And yet one piece refuses to bow to my lordship,
<ce>         this unruly vermin called %pcf, who thinks %pg2self
<ce>                 greater than one chosen by the gods.
<ce>
<ce>                  "So you must know by now! Tell me!
<ce>              TELL ME WHERE THE TOTEM IS BEFORE I SLICE
<ce>                 YOUR THROAT LIKE THE WORM YOU ARE!"
<ce>
<ce>                He lunges at you and draws his blade.

Message:  1012
<ce>         Lord Woodborne is dead, and so ends the most urgent
<ce>           threat to your life. Hopefully the other rulers
<ce>          of the Iliac Bay will be more open to negotiation.
