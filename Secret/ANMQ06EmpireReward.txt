Message:  1010
<ce>  A messenger wearing the Empire's crest
<ce>  gives you a letter, and bows deeply
<ce>  before departing in silence.

Message:  1011
%pcn,
<ce>
You are a hero to the Empire. I sent you
for a trifling matter, and you persevered
as it grew into something much larger.
I was not wrong to send you, but I never
could have imagined how right I truly was!
We shall expend the full forces of the
Imperial City to keep the Totem safe.
Once Numidium's heart returns, we shall
re-establish order in the Iliac Bay and
give peace to all its troubled people.
<ce>
With an unending gratitude,
Your friend forever, in life and death,
Past, present and future,
Uriel Septim VII, Emperor of Tamriel
<ce>
Penned by my own hand
