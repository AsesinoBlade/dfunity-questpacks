<ce>  "Letter for %pcn! Hello there!
<ce>  Is that you? Gotta go, take this!"
<ce>  
<ce>  A courier atop a horse shoves a stack
<ce>  of parchment into your hands and rides off swiftly.
<ce>  You look at the papers and find them blank, but
<ce>  tucked within there's a glowing object.
<ce>  You fail to drop it quickly enough...

Message:  1011
<ce>  "Finally. Get ready, you two."
<ce>  
<ce>  Your eyes adjust to the darkness and find a warrior
<ce>  before you who you don't recognize. You have
<ce>  no time for introductions.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Well, %pcf, I'm glad to finally meet you.
<ce>  You're quite hard to corner, aren't you?
<ce>  Like the rat you are, scurrying every which way
<ce>  to ruin my plans.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I am Lord Woodborne, and I am the rightful heir of
<ce>  the Numidium, precisely as it is written in
<ce>  the Elder Scrolls. It is my destiny to take up
<ce>  Tiber Septim's mantle, build a new empire
<ce>  in the wake of Uriel's failure to lead,
<ce>  and crush every one of my foes across Tamriel.
<ce>  
<ce>  "And yet one piece refuses to bow to my lordship,
<ce>  this unruly vermin called %pcf, who thinks %pg2self
<ce>  greater than one chosen by the gods.
<ce>  
<ce>  "So you must know by now! Tell me! TELL ME
<ce>  WHERE THE TOTEM IS BEFORE I SLICE YOUR
<ce>  THROAT LIKE THE WORM YOU ARE!"
<ce>  
<ce>  He lunges at you and draws his blade.

Message:  1012
<ce>  Lord Woodborne is dead, and so ends the most urgent
<ce>  threat to your life. Hopefully the other rulers
<ce>  of the Iliac Bay will be more open to negotiation.
