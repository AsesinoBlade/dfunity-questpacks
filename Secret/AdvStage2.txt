Message:  1010
<ce>  A raven, jet black, drops a folded letter near you.
<ce>  You pick it up and see the words written on the flap,
<ce>  "For %pcf only."

Message:  1011
<ce>  Greetings, %pcf. I suppose this will put our
<ce>  interpreter gems to the test, now won't it? (Br'itsa)
<ce>  
<ce>  Greetings indeed. We have consulted among ourselves
<ce>  and decided that you need to speak to Medora and
<ce>  Nulfaga. (Karethys)
<ce>  
<ce>  Nulfaga is the mother of the recently slain King Lysandus
<ce>  of Daggerfall. She lives in a castle called Shedungent,
<ce>  hidden away in the Dragontail Mountains. It's quite a trip.
<ce>  See the back side of this letter for its location.
<ce>  Tell her door to shut up. Popudax thinks he remembers
<ce>  some treasure in her castle that'd be useful. (Karethys)
<ce>  
<ce>  Medora resides in her tower on the Isle of Balfiera.
<ce>  The Emperor's letter said Numidium is outside the tower,
<ce>  so maybe she would know something about it. She doesn't
<ce>  have any loyalty to anyone. With any luck she'll listen
<ce>  to reason and give us some direction on activating
<ce>  Numidium or finding the Totem. (Br'itsa)
<ce>  
<ce>  Both women are among of the most powerful magicians
<ce>  in all Tamriel. If we speak of arcane objects capable
<ce>  of destroying the world, they should know. (Karethys)
<ce>  
<ce>  If you find anything out of your depth, bring it to me.
<ce>  No matter what happens, Lainlyn should be safe from
<ce>  the chaos that's starting to envelop the Bay.
<ce>  If Daggerfall and Wayrest get too dangerous,
<ce>  you can always spend a few days around here. (Br'itsa)
