Message:  1010
<ce>  So you've returned at last. I don't want
<ce>  to know who has the Totem. Perhaps you
<ce>  carry it even now, and think you'll unleash its
<ce>  power on this fallen world upon your return.
<ce>  Much as I wish you could, reactivating Numidium
<ce>  will not be so simple.
<ce>  
<ce>  To regain the machine's heart, I must send you to
<ce>  a different dimensional plane where it resides.
<ce>  I will get you close, but you will yet have a
<ce>  journey to undertake. The heart is a large
<ce>  green gem suspended in the air somewhere
<ce>  in the other plane. You must merely touch it,
<ce>  and it will return you to this tower.
<ce>  
<ce>  After that? It's impossible to say. Perhaps
<ce>  it will spring to life and give its holder
<ce>  power to annihilate. I doubt it. More likely
<ce>  it will take months or even years to fully recover.
<ce>  No one will ever know, except the heart itself.
<ce>  
<ce>  You will be stranded on the other side until
<ce>  you find the heart. Mark and Recall spells will
<ce>  be useless. Therefore, you must prepare.
<ce>  
<ce>  Are you ready to go?

<ce>  Then speak to me when you are.
