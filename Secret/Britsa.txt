<ce>   

Message:  1010
<ce>  Hello there! %pcf, you say? Perhaps the same
<ce>  %pcf that Popudax told me to expect?
<ce>  I'd be happy to talk with you, but
<ce>  I have tasks that really can't wait.
<ce>  
<ce>  Hmm, I have an idea. I need to keep my dues
<ce>  with the Mages Guild up to date. Could you
<ce>  accompany me to ___mondung_ and help me grab
<ce>  some _ingred_? We can talk once inside.
<ce>  Sorry I can't spare any more time for you,
<ce>  but this journey gives us a good opportunity.
<ce>  Let me mark it on your map. I'll meet you there.

Message:  1011
<ce>  You find Br'itsa near the entrance.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Glad you made it safely, %pcf. Would you be willing
<ce>  to lead the way? I have some things to talk about, but
<ce>  I want to get my thoughts in order."

Message:  1012
<ce>  "It's clear the race to gain power over Numidium has
<ce>  already begun. Even here in Lainlyn, talk has started
<ce>  about which side we'll align with. We've already started
<ce>  sending ambassadors to both Sentinel and Wayrest,
<ce>  in case either of them is the winner.
<ce>  Imagine if it ended up in the hands of the Orcs,
<ce>  or worse, the King of Worms! The kingdoms of men
<ce>  could be destroyed in a month."

Message:  1013
<ce>  "Now, a bit of a sensitive topic. I don't mean to pry into
<ce>  your thoughts, but who have you thought about giving control
<ce>  to, were you to find it? I wish to tell you about my personal
<ce>  leaning, if I dare be so bold.
<ce>
<ce>  "The Underking is not who Popudax or the Emperor or anyone else
<ce>  thinks about him. He is merely a man, or was one, ages ago.
<ce>  He was the one who created the power source for Numidium.
<ce>  Somehow, he continues to live to this day. His one wish is for
<ce>  Numidium, and the destruction it has caused, to no longer be.
<ce>  That's what his followers tell me, anyway.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Does that all sound too simple? Too easy? I could be wrong.
<ce>  I've spoken with some of his people, and they all recite the same
<ce>  story. I have come to believe them. Perhaps I am deceived,
<ce>  or too easily swayed. But if it were true, how much better would
<ce>  it be than to commit it to the hands of a king, or even Uriel
<ce>  Septim himself?"

Message:  1014
<ce>  "Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. Until we find out where
<ce>  this apparent 'Totem' is that controls Numidium, and what
<ce>  the source of power is, this is all just an academic exercise.
<ce>  We should find that _ingred_. I have more
<ce>  I wish to speak about, but I'll gather my thoughts first."

Message:  1015
<ce>  "Ah, here it is. Very fine, indeed. This should keep
<ce>  the Mages Guild off my back for a while more.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Have you thought about communication? We're not such
<ce>  powerful mages as the Direnni to blast our words into
<ce>  your skull. We'll have to use letters, but
<ce>  they'll need to be coded. You'll need a cipher
<ce>  of some kind... Let me think on the way out."

Message:  1016
<ce>  As you and Br'itsa emerge from the cave,
<ce>  you're surprised to see a pair of Orc sergeants
<ce>  waiting for you outside, maintaining a respectful distance.
<ce>  One kneels, and the other bows and begins to shout
<ce>  haltingly in the common tongue.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Great %ra, friend of orcs! Lord Gortwog wish
<ce>  to speak! In Orsinium, he waits for you,
<ce>  and talk of future and plans!
<ce>  Warriors will test you, no fear!
<ce>  Come when ready and see honesty!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The other pulls out a map and points at the location
<ce>  of Orsinium City from afar. They then march off to the east.

Message:  1017
<ce>  Once they're out of earshot, Br'itsa shudders.
<ce>  
<ce>  "%oth. Imagine what it would be like if savages
<ce>  like them held the Totem. Don't bother talking to them.
<ce>  Nothing good could come of it. They'd sooner hold you hostage
<ce>  or torture you for sport. You'd have to be mad to try it.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Okay! Well, I have something for you. I was working
<ce>  on it on the way out." She hands you a small, dark gem.
<ce>  "I'm going to make one for Popudax and Karethys.
<ce>  If we have something to say, it'll be via coded messages.
<ce>  We don't have your freedom to leave whenever we want.
<ce>  Just look through the gem at the letters, and you'll see
<ce>  what they should say. Without this cipher it'll be impossible,
<ce>  so don't lose it.
<ce>
<ce>  "Well, I'm headed back to Lainlyn. I'll try to send you
<ce>  any useful information I can. Popudax thinks you're the best
<ce>  chance we have of getting to a proper solution to this mess...
<ce>  Everyone else has some kingdom or alliance to pertain to.
<ce>  You're the only free agent with some degree of mobility.
<ce>  The Emperor's trust in you is ours as well. I just hope,
<ce>  if you get that far, that you'll make the right choice,
<ce>  whatever it is. Safe travels, %pcf."
