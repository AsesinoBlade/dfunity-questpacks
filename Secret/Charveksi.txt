Message:  1010
<ce>  "So the great Popudax has sent you to me, is that it?
<ce>  How wild! I didn't think he knew I existed!" She blushes
<ce>  momentarily before regaining some composure. "Well,
<ce>  yes, I'm certain we have things to discuss. I'm sure I could
<ce>  arrange a nice outing to discuss politics with you!"
<ce>  She then whispers, "Too many ears and eyes here.
<ce>  Meet me at ___shrine_, here in Wayrest."
<ce>  
<ce>  She then gathers up her things and announces she's heading out
<ce>  for a while. Prince Helseth glares at you from across the gallery
<ce>  for making her leave.

Message:  1011
<ce>  Charvek-si is waiting for you in this open clearing.
<ce>  She waves at the shrine attendant, who turns a blind
<ce>  eye to your discussion.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Ah, so glad to be out of that stuffy castle. We Dark Elves
<ce>  were never meant to stay buried under rock and stone.
<ce>  But yes, we have important things to talk about, don't we?
<ce>  
<ce>  "Popudax was more than right. The news spread like wildfire.
<ce>  They're trying to keep it away from the populace for the
<ce>  panic it would cause, but every royal family is fully aware
<ce>  of the coming crisis. They've already sent platoons out across
<ce>  their respective regions to dig up whatever hole or cave they
<ce>  can, to see if they can find clues about how to revive or control
<ce>  Numidium. But they won't find the Totem. Know why?"
<ce>  
<ce>  She reaches into her handbag and pulls out a small ebony statue.
<ce>  "Because I have it right here! See?" She puts it in your hands and
<ce>  lets you examine it. Then she bursts out laughing. "I'm just kidding.
<ce>  That's not the Totem. Because you know what would happen if
<ce>  you actually had the Totem in your hands?
<ce>  
<ce>  "Armies would combine just to pry it from you. Then those armies would
<ce>  massacre themselves for the slight chance they could run away with it
<ce>  themselves. The dead would rise up by the Necromancers to devour
<ce>  you and take it away. You'd never sleep, eat, or find a moment of
<ce>  peace again, until it left your hands.
<ce>  
<ce>  "So think about it. Finding the Totem is one thing, but walking around
<ce>  with it? That's another. You don't just walk from one city to another, let
<ce>  alone across borders, with the key to world domination in your hands.
<ce>  So you've got to find some way to transport it without moving.
<ce>  Are you thinking yet?"

Message:  1012
<ce>  The sound of dragging feet surprises you. Something unnatural
<ce>  is moving nearby, and it's coming closer. You and Charvek-si
<ce>  cut your conversation short as you look around for the
<ce>  interruption.
<ce>  
<ce>  A cloaked figure is approaching. It doesn't take long
<ce>  to realize it has no skin. Its finger bones clank on
<ce>  one another, its legs rattle, and its jaw clatters.
<ce>  At a short distance, it speaks to you.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Hello, young ones! Forgive me for breaking up your play date.
<ce>  I merely heard the word 'Totem' and couldn't restrain
<ce>  my curiosity. Mind if I have a word?"
<ce>  
<ce>  Charvek-si's eyes go wide. She starts to cast a spell, but
<ce>  the undead figure speaks first.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Don't waste your time. It wouldn't be me you destroy.
<ce>  This lich? The slightest representation of my power.
<ce>  For I am the King of Worms, and wherever there are dead,
<ce>  I have ears to hear. Now then, don't let me interrupt you.
<ce>  Tell me about this Totem. I'd love to hear more."
<ce>  
<ce>  Your companion shouts back, "We don't know anything! We
<ce>  don't have it or know where it is!" The voice retorts,
<ce>  "I don't expect you to have it. And I already know more than
<ce>  you do about it. So have you really said everything you know?"
<ce>  
<ce>  The lich gestures, and four zombies rise up from the earth.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I'm serious! We don't know anything!" Charvek-si screams.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Good. Then I'll make sure you stay that way." The zombies
<ce>  lurch forward to attack. Charvek-si begins to
<ce>  cast a spell. It may take a little while to finish.

Message:  1013
<ce>  "There! It's done!" Charvek-si shouts, and
<ce>  multiple figures appear to aid in the fight.

Message:  1014
<ce>  "What a show," the lich claps its bony hands together.
<ce>  If perhaps you're interested in getting that Totem,
<ce>  and want to gain some power from the dark arts,
<ce>  you should come see me in Scourg Barrow.
<ce>  You're both invited."
<ce>  
<ce>  A rough map of the Dragontail Mountains is burned into
<ce>  the ground in front of you, and an X marks the presumed
<ce>  location of his lair.
<ce>  
<ce>  "We don't need you! Leave us alone! Charvek-si screams.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Well, the invitation's there," the King of Worms answers.
<ce>  The lich then decomposes, leaving you two alone.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Okay, so. We can't talk out in the open like this."
<ce>  The Dark Elf struggles to catch her breath. "I'm heading back
<ce>  to Wayrest. I'll leave you to think about it:
<ce>  once you get the Totem, what would you do with it?
<ce>  You need a plan. You step into the daylight with that thing,
<ce>  and you're dead..." She sighs, "As demonstrated."
<ce>  
<ce>  "Thank you for hearing me out. I have no loyalty to Wayrest,
<ce>  only the people of Tamriel. I'll try as hard as I can to serve
<ce>  the highest purpose, whatever that is. Stay safe, %pcf."
