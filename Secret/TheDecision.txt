<ce>   You dearly hope you made the right decision.

Message:  1010
<ce>  With the Totem in your hands, you open the portal.
<ce>  Only one will win in the end, and you know you
<ce>  won't survive long enough for Numidium to charge up.
<ce>  Control has to go to someone. The question is, who?

Message:  1011
<ce>  Will you give the Totem to Daggerfall?

Message:  1012
<ce>  Will you give the Totem to Sentinel?

Message:  1013
<ce>  Will you give the Totem to Wayrest?

Message:  1014
<ce>  Will you give the Totem to the Emperor?

Message:  1015
<ce>  Will you give the Totem to Orsinium?

Message:  1016
<ce>  Will you give the Totem to the King of Worms?

Message:  1017
<ce>  Will you give the Totem to the Underking?

Message:  1020
<ce>  You take a deep breath and try to concentrate.
<ce>  Someone has to get the Totem. The question is, who?

Message: 1021
<ce>  You point the portal toward the court
<ce>  of Daggerfall Castle. In an instant you see Gothryd
<ce>  and Aubk-i on their thrones. You toss the Totem directly
<ce>  into his lap, before the portal fails. He is stunned, but
<ce>  smiles and waves to you once you tell him what he's holding.
<ce>  Just before the portal breaks, you see the deeply concerned
<ce>  face of the court sorcerer.

Message:  1022
<ce>  You point the portal toward Sentinel Palace and locate
<ce>  Queen Akorithi in her throne room. You toss the Totem
<ce>  through and explain what it is.
<ce>  
<ce>  "You are a friend forever to the people of Sentinel!
<ce>  We shall guard it with our armies and ensure no harm
<ce>  shall come of it! I swear it!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The portal then breaks, and you are left alone.

Message:  1023
<ce>  You point the portal toward Wayrest Castle and locate
<ce>  King Eadwyre and Queen Barenziah. They are shocked
<ce>  to see you, but their attitude abruptly changes
<ce>  when they see you toss the Totem through and explain
<ce>  what it is.
<ce>  
<ce>  Eadwyre shouts, "You are a hero to the people of Wayrest
<ce>  and all High Rock! Wayrest shall stand forever, and
<ce>  we will share this power with the Emperor!
<ce>  You have nothing to fear from this decision, my friend!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The portal then breaks, and you are left alone.

Message:  1024
<ce>  You point the portal toward the Imperial City, and see
<ce>  the Emperor's familiar court room. It feels as though
<ce>  it has been ages since you departed for this mission.
<ce>  The Emperor stares at you through the portal, wide-eyed.
<ce>  When you throw in the Totem and explain what it is,
<ce>  he becomes elated.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Thank you, my friend! Everything is now as it should be!
<ce>  We shall ensure its safety forevermore, of all Tamriel!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The portal then breaks, and you are left alone.

Message:  1025
<ce>  You point the portal toward Gortwog's throne room.
<ce>  He is at first startled at the alien apparition before
<ce>  him, but takes courage once you explain you are
<ce>  giving him the Totem.
<ce>  
<ce>  "You are a true warrior, %ra! A hero of my people!
<ce>  We will never forget your deed!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The portal then breaks, and you are left alone.

Message:  1026
<ce>  You point the portal toward Scourg Barrow, directly
<ce>  before the King of Worms. He recognizes the
<ce>  Totem immediately and expresses his profuse joy.
<ce>  
<ce>  "By the gods of Aetherius, my thanks are everlasting,
<ce>  %ra! No mortal can be entrusted such tremendous power!
<ce>  I alone am capable, and I will remember this forever!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The portal then breaks, and you are left alone.

Message:  1027
<ce>  You point the portal toward the Underking's agent,
<ce>  who gratefully accepts the Totem.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Hear these words from my master! 'For centuries
<ce>  I have sought atonement for my foolishness in
<ce>  giving life to the Numidium. Once its power
<ce>  is restored, I will take it unto myself.
<ce>  Tamriel will be safe, and I will finally rest.'
<ce>  %ra, we owe you more than words can tell!"
