<ce>   "Greetings, %ra. State your business."
<ce>  
<ce>  You produce the Seal of the Emperor's Agent given to you
<ce>  prior to your departure from the Imperial City,
<ce>  and ask concerning the Emperor's letter. As expected,
<ce>  Aubk-i looks bewildered.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I receive no mail from the Emperor. I hardly know the man,
<ce>  even from afar. Why would he send anything to me?
<ce>  In truth, no one here has contact with the Imperial City
<ce>  save Lysandus himself."
<ce>  
<ce>  Your requests concerning Lysandus are likewise fruitless.
<ce>  Aubk-i knows nothing at all, and a few members of the court
<ce>  step in to provide basic facts previously known: he led
<ce>  his troops in the war against Sentinel and died in the
<ce>  Battle of Cryngaine Field one year ago. An unusual fog covered
<ce>  the field, giving both sides a disadvantage. In the limited
<ce>  visibility, Lysandus was slain and his pack was torn open.
<ce>  
<ce>  "And that is how my dear Gothryd ascended to the throne."
<ce>  The King of Daggerfall glares at you, barely able to tolerate
<ce>  your presence. "I am the daughter of the Queen of Sentinel, and
<ce>  our marriage is a pact of peace between the two nations. Never
<ce>  again will the Iliac Bay be plunged into such bitter warfare.
<ce>  Our descendants will be living proof of our commitment,
<ce>  one nation to another."
<ce>  
<ce>  Though you learned little, you thank the court for their time.

<ce>  As you leave the castle, you find someone waiting for you outside.
<ce>  A hood prevents you from seeing his face.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Mind doing business, %ra? That's a nice seal you've got on you.
<ce>  Could be quite useful in my line of work. I'd be happy to tell
<ce>  you where the Emperor's letter is, if that were in my hands."
<ce>  
<ce>  You grip the Seal of the Emperor's Agent tightly. You turn it over
<ce>  again and again, contemplating the decision. It hasn't helped you yet,
<ce>  as the royalty of the Iliac Bay clearly don't know more than you do.
<ce>  After weighing your options, you offer it up.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Not bad. You're quite smart. A lot of people wouldn't
<ce>  give up authority for progress. But I won't waste your time.
<ce>  It's in ___mondung_. An idiot from my guild
<ce>  stole it en route to the Queen, then thought to hide up
<ce>  in there waiting for a ransom. Moron got executed before he could
<ce>  even explain the deal. Get there fast. I'll mark it on your map.
<ce>  
<ce>  "As for me? I just got a great deal on a seal. Worth more than
<ce>  some crummy letter, I'll tell you that much." The hooded figure
<ce>  tosses it in the air, and then retreats.
<ce>  
<ce>  You also seem to hear other footsteps moving away from the castle.
