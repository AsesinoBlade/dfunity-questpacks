<ce>  A courier wearing the crest of Daggerfall
<ce>  gives you a message and departs.

<ce>  Word has it Lord Woodborne, an important
<ce>  noble of Wayrest, was slain recently. No one knows
<ce>  by whom. There's a maid here named Cyndassa
<ce>  who wants to speak to you now that he's dead.
<ce>  I promised her nothing, but should you feel so
<ce>  inclined, you may find her in Castle Daggerfall.

<ce>  Oh wow! So the court wizard really has some pull, don't he?
<ce>  He told me you might never come 'round here again.
<ce>  Well, glad you did. Wanted to talk to you 'bout that
<ce>  old schmuck Woodborne who was after you.
<ce>  
<ce>  Well, let me start at the beginning. Fellow was always
<ce>  a megalomaniac. Big eyes on the prize and all that.
<ce>  Convinced himself he was born for greatness.
<ce>  He and Gothryd were best friends for years.
<ce>  Their parents hoped they'd help forge some amazing
<ce>  alliance between Daggerfall and Wayrest someday.
<ce>  Well, anyway. One day Lysandus gets this letter from
<ce>  the Emperor talkin' 'bout Numidium, and that it's
<ce>  the end of the world as we know it or somesuch.
<ce>  Lysandus goes and tells his son, tries to think
<ce>  'bout it out loud with him. Problem is, doesn't
<ce>  know his son very well. Sneaky little rodent went
<ce>  and told Lord Woodborne all about it, and they plot
<ce>  to get that letter from Lysandus by any means possible,
<ce>  thinkin' it'll lead 'em to Numidium.
<ce>  
<ce>  Around that time was the Battle at Cryngaine Field.
<ce>  Unnatural fog comes in, and Lysandus is killed by
<ce>  Woodborne's archers from afar. Big confusion then, and
<ce>  Gothryd tears open his daddy's pack while everyone else
<ce>  is running 'round in a panic. Bad luck for him,
<ce>  Lysandus already destroyed the letter, just
<ce>  like the Emperor told him to. Shoulda acted
<ce>  sooner, is all. Then came the second letter from the
<ce>  Emperor, the one you was looking for. Lysandus apparently
<ce>  didn't send him an answer soon enough, so Uriel thought
<ce>  the first one got lost or buried or something. Second letter
<ce>  goes to the Queen, since the King's out fightin'. But the second
<ce>  letter got stole before it got here, you know that story already.
<ce>  Since then they's been playing catch-up on all the details,
<ce>  and they're all behind the ball now.
<ce>  Well, except for Woodborne. He's dead.
<ce>  
<ce>  So why'm I tellin' you 'bout this now? 'Cause the
<ce>  big critter's six feet under. While alive he'd
<ce>  kill practically anybody to get his way. He's dead now,
<ce>  and Gothryd's slimy but not slimy enough to just murder
<ce>  people. He don't kill kings or maids or people like that
<ce>  just for talkin' 'bout him. What I told you's gonna get
<ce>  swept under the rug. Not a single person's gonna believe
<ce>  dumb ol' Cyndassa anyway. Why bother?
<ce>
<ce>  And how'd I know all this? They'd talk right by me, since they
<ce>  thought I was just a no-brain peasant. "Moron," "cow-girl,"
<ce>  "pudding-brain," they laughed as they made their plans
<ce>  within earshot. They never thought this dumb little
<ce>  servant girl would even care, much less remember it all!
<ce>  Shows you the small brain in the room now, don't it?
<ce>  
<ce>  So glad to get that off my chest! Carrying secrets is
<ce>  hard, you know? I'm not carrying their water around
<ce>  no more, no sirree! Feels a lot better to be saying that now.
