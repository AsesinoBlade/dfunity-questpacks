Message:  1011
<ce>  An extravagantly-dressed courier with the
<ce>  crest of Wayrest appears with a letter for you.

Message:  1012
<ce>  A small troupe from Daggerfall deliver you
<ce>  a letter and then turn away.

Message:  1013
<ce>  An Orcish shaman with a solemn face
<ce>  gives you a missive and walks away.

Message:  1014
<ce>  A sparrow drops a letter on the ground near you.
<ce>  You recognize the coded writing as from Br'itsa.

Message:  1015
<ce>  A courier from the Imperial City presents you a letter
<ce>  and departs.

Message:  1016
<ce>  A lurching, decrepit body shambles toward you
<ce>  and expires. You notice and take a letter in its hand.

Message:  1017
<ce>  Now outside the castle, a group of Sentinel's
<ce>  royal soldiers approach you and deliver a letter.

<ce>  
<ce>  I will be quick. In the vaults of Wayrest I have
<ce>  stored the Warlock's Ring and the Staff
<ce>  of Magnus. If you find and give me the Totem,
<ce>  they are yours. You will also earn the
<ce>  everlasting esteem of the Court of Wayrest.
<ce>  
<ce>  King Eadwyre
<ce>  Wayrest

Message:  1022
<ce>  To %pcn, Imperial Agent
<ce>  
<ce>  Please consider granting the power of the Totem
<ce>  to Daggerfall. I know we have not spoken much
<ce>  due to my duties as king. I beg you, do not
<ce>  misunderstand me. I am fully prepared to
<ce>  grant you two legendary artifacts, the
<ce>  Necromancer's Amulet and the Lord's Mail,
<ce>  if you can somehow deliver the Totem
<ce>  into my hands. I swear it before any
<ce>  witnesses you choose. You will also become
<ce>  a hero among all my people.
<ce>  
<ce>  King Gothryd, Daggerfall

Message:  1023
<ce>  Honorable %pcn
<ce>  
<ce>  We are two creatures of honor, you and I.
<ce>  All my commitments, I will keep. If you
<ce>  will grant me the Totem, I swear as follows:
<ce>  
<ce>  I will establish Orsinium as a safe land
<ce>  for the people of the orcs.
<ce>  
<ce>  I will protect my people and never attack
<ce>  the Bretons or the Redguards, save
<ce>  for self-defense.
<ce>  
<ce>  I will leave the lands of all humans alone,
<ce>  except half the Wrothgarian Mountains which
<ce>  I shall claim for our home. I will make all
<ce>  efforts to expulse the denizens by peaceful means.
<ce>  
<ce>  Numidium shall be the everlasting possession
<ce>  of the orcs, never to be sold or gifted, or
<ce>  used for aggression in any war.
<ce>  
<ce>  I have so sworn it.
<ce>  
<ce>  If you will ignore my plea, my people will die,
<ce>  so sure as the sun will set.
<ce>  
<ce>  Gortwog, Lord of the Orcs

Message:  1024
<ce>  %pcf,
<ce>  
<ce>  Do you remember what I told you about the
<ce>  Underking? Please consider the future of
<ce>  Tamriel. I understand now why the Underking
<ce>  still exists. Numidium requires his heart,
<ce>  heavily enchanted, as a power source.
<ce>  The Underking needs his heart to die. He struggles
<ce>  on as a half-entity, year after year, unable to stop
<ce>  existing. Let him, and let Numidium die
<ce>  with him. This is the only way to
<ce>  prevent catastrophe. Please, hear me.
<ce>  I've included a map of Cyrodiil and the
<ce>  place where the Underking's servants
<ce>  congregate. If you can get it there,
<ce>  it will be safe from everyone; Tamriel's
<ce>  greatest secret.
<ce>  
<ce>  Your friend, Br'itsa

Message:  1025
<ce>  To my friend %pcn
<ce>  Last known region: ____here_
<ce>  
<ce>  Message dictated to High Chancellor Ocato
<ce>  
<ce>  Your progress has been most satisfactory,
<ce>  my champion. You must not tarry. Wars
<ce>  already begin to break out among the
<ce>  people of the Iliac Bay. Please,
<ce>  find some way to deliver me the Totem
<ce>  as quickly as possible. I will restore order
<ce>  and ensure the Empire's peace remains
<ce>  upon all these innocent people
<ce>  at risk of the monarchs' wrath.
<ce>  
<ce>  The Divines protect you
<ce>  Uriel Septim VII

Message:  1026
<ce>  %pcn
<ce>  
<ce>  Not far from discovering the Totem, are you?
<ce>  You are wise to mistrust the craven mortals.
<ce>  We both know ruin will come to this land should
<ce>  you give Numidium's power to any of them.
<ce>  
<ce>  I will not awaken Numidium at all. The machine is
<ce>  powered by a divine, magical heart. I will consume
<ce>  that heart and with its power move on to a new dimension,
<ce>  leaving all these cares behind. The brass golem
<ce>  need never rise at all.
<ce>  
<ce>  In return, I would be happy to give you some power
<ce>  in the dark arts. You will not be disappointed
<ce>  with what I share!
<ce>  
<ce>  The King of Worms
<ce>  Scourg Barrow, Dragontail Mountains

Message:  1027
<ce>  To %pcn
<ce>  
<ce>  150,000 gold coins. I have emptied my vaults,
<ce>  liquidated my ship, and sold every loose object
<ce>  in my house that I could without arousing the
<ce>  fear of the peasantry. That, and endless fame
<ce>  among the people of Sentinel, are yours
<ce>  if you give me the Totem. Buy a ship and free
<ce>  yourself of the troubles of Tamriel.
<ce>  Live your own life. Or purchase a house here
<ce>  in Sentinel. We will welcome you as our own.
<ce>  
<ce>  The people of Sentinel will guard Numidium
<ce>  as our own, and it will defend our lands.
<ce>  We will never fear invasion again, nor will
<ce>  we strike against any nation with it.
<ce>  All lands will be at peace if the machine
<ce>  is given to us.
<ce>  
<ce>  So sworn,
<ce>  Queen Aubk-i, Sentinel
