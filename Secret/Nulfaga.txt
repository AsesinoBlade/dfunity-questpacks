<ce>  (ETIQUETTE/PERSONALITY CHECK FAILED)
<ce>  
<ce>  You introduce yourself to Nulfaga,
<ce>  grandmother to King Gothryd and
<ce>  mother of the deceased Lysandus.
<ce>  You explain your mission from the Emperor
<ce>  and your referral from the royal courts
<ce>  to find help in finding or transporting
<ce>  the Totem.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Totem? You want a Totem? I'm afraid
<ce>  my coffers are empty unto you, child.
<ce>  The Emperor has shown me no kindness
<ce>  since the loss of my son, and
<ce>  I am an exile in this cold, barren fortress.
<ce>  Ask your Emperor for your help, and leave me be."
<ce>  
<ce>  Though Nulfaga refuses to help you, it appears
<ce>  she won't force you to leave Shedungent.
<ce>  Maybe there's something here to help you.

<ce>  You introduce yourself to Nulfaga,

<ce>  You explain your mission from the Emperor

<ce>  the Totem.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Well, I've never heard of a Totem.
<ce>  Is it valuable? Will it help keep Daggerfall
<ce>  safe? My spoiled grandson can't run a military.
<ce>  His wizard should be running things, I think.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Well, if you need help moving it,
<ce>  I think one of the treasures here could
<ce>  help. Opens a small portal for a short time.
<ce>  Came from the Thieves Guild, they say.
<ce>  Can't send a person through, but if
<ce>  this Totem isn't so big, you could
<ce>  probably throw it through so it could
<ce>  reach the throne room pretty fair.
<ce>  
<ce>  "It's somewhere in this castle, let's see...
<ce>  Northwest? Go out that door to the north and
<ce>  wrap around to the west, and then...
<ce>  %oth, I don't remember. But it's
<ce>  in there somewhere. Go find it and
<ce>  learn to use it. And tell that brat
<ce>  grandson of mine to respect his elders
<ce>  with a visit now and then, why don't you."

Message:  1012
<ce>  This simple-looking wand seems to exude
<ce>  power. You test it on your surroundings,
<ce>  and find that it's capable of opening
<ce>  small portals to destinations that you
<ce>  think of. This kind of thing could be
<ce>  extremely dangerous. You pack it away
<ce>  and try not to touch it at all.

Message:  1013
<ce>  Nulfaga refused to tell me anything,
<ce>  but I am free to search Shedungent for myself.

Message:  1014
<ce>  Nulfaga told me something useful may be in
<ce>  the northwest area of the castle, starting from
<ce>  her throne room.
