<ce>  %pcn,
<ce>  
<ce>  Our utmost thanks to you for delivering the
<ce>  Totem into our hands. Our master awaits the
<ce>  activation of the heart before he can finally
<ce>  rest, but we pray that day not be far off.
<ce>  We, too, will then also rest.
<ce>  
<ce>  We have hidden the Totem with a perfect guise.
<ce>  Neither High Rock nor Hammerfell suspect
<ce>  that we possess it. Because of your
<ce>  wise choice, all regions may expect lasting
<ce>  peace. Our fullest thanks to you, hero.
<ce>  
<ce>  Signed,
<ce>  Your friends.
