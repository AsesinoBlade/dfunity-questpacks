<ce>  "Hmm? Identify yourself or be slain."
<ce>  
<ce>  You cautiously explain that the Emperor has sent
<ce>  you to find the power to control Numidium,
<ce>  and that you intend no one any harm.
<ce>  She hesitates, and then casts a spell
<ce>  that makes your head hurt.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Maybe I'm a fool. Or maybe I just don't care anymore."
<ce>  
<ce>  She releases the spell on you. Just as you start
<ce>  to fear for her mental stability,
<ce>  the woman lowers her hands. 
<ce>  
<ce>  "The only man worthy to direct Numidium in this
<ce>  bleak age was my beloved Lysandus. His heart was
<ce>  perfect. He would never harm a soul. Now that he
<ce>  is dead... What do I care for this wretched sphere?
<ce>  
<ce>  "I've read your memories and know your purpose.
<ce>  If you have a mind to unleash Numidium on the world,
<ce>  I care nothing for its destruction. The machine
<ce>  was created with a few rules, one of them to never
<ce>  harm this tower. I can watch the world burn from
<ce>  my own roof. Perhaps... that is what I truly desire.
<ce>  
<ce>  "The location of the Totem, I cannot tell you.
<ce>  But a tool was created ages ago that can reveal it.
<ce>  Unbeknownst to them, the royal family of Sentinel
<ce>  holds this tool in their vaults. Search for it in the
<ce>  most guarded place. It will require a magical charge,
<ce>  but a much lesser mage than I can do that.
<ce>  Once empowered, it will show you where to find the Totem
<ce>  and undo its invisibility enchantment.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Still, you don't know what the Totem looks like.
<ce>  This is it." She casts a short spell,
<ce>  and your mind is flooded with the image of
<ce>  a small, oval statue in the shape of a baby.
<ce>  "You'll need that when the time comes."
<ce>  
<ce>  "As you consulted with those friends of yours,
<ce>  you can't hold on to the Totem for very long,
<ce>  for others will slay you. Work out your plan
<ce>  for how you're going to deliver it to the
<ce>  right person, whoever that is. When your
<ce>  plan is ready, come to me at the very end.
<ce>  I will tell you about Numidium's
<ce>  power source, and we will begin the end
<ce>  of Tamriel together."

Message:  1010
<ce>  My visit with Medora was very fruitful.
<ce>  She said I can find a tool to locate the
<ce>  Totem in the dungeons under Sentinel Palace.
<ce>  It needs to be activated somehow by a mage.
<ce>  She also said she doesn't care who gets
<ce>  the Totem, and when I've delivered it,
<ce>  I should return to her to talk about the
<ce>  power source for Numidium.
