<ce>  Somewhere underneath this castle,
<ce>  in the most secure place, a tool will
<ce>  show you the Totem's location.

<ce>  You're surprised to find a telescope here.
<ce>  A small sign hangs off of it: "Broken."
<ce>  Apparently it was consigned here
<ce>  once the royal family couldn't find a
<ce>  use for it. Nevertheless, the bill of purchase
<ce>  you find inside it represents too much money
<ce>  to simply throw away.
<ce>  
<ce>  You look through the telescope and can see
<ce>  a castle, far away in a forest.
<ce>  You zoom the lens out as much as possible and
<ce>  see a coast to the north. You gain your bearings
<ce>  with some nearby villages and generally orient
<ce>  the location in the region of Ykalon. Then
<ce>  you zoom in for more detail and see the words,
<ce>  "Castle Llugwych."
<ce>  
<ce>  Try as you might, you can't look at any other
<ce>  destination with the telescope. No amount of turning
<ce>  leads anywhere else. If Lady Direnni spoke right,
<ce>  this has to be the right place.
<ce>  
<ce>  Last of all, you find a small button on the base
<ce>  of the telescope. You press it and an enchantment
<ce>  shoots forth onto your body. If you needed some way
<ce>  to see through the Totem's invisibility enchantment,
<ce>  you hope this is it.
