%qdt:
 I am on a mission from the emperor to investigate
 a letter he sent to the Queen of ___dagg_.
 If I should find out what happened to the letter
 and then destroy it, he would be most appreciative.
 He also warned me that the spirit of Lysandus, former
 king of Daggerfall, haunts the capitol city.
 If possible, I should find the cause and put
 the spirit to rest.
