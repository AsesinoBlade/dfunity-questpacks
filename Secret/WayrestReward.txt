<ce>  "Well, aren't you a surprising one?
<ce>  
<ce>  "I suspected a great deal when I heard
<ce>  you were consorting with Karethys.
<ce>  I put my concerns to bed when you stopped
<ce>  coming to the castle, but then the news
<ce>  spread like wildfire. I cannot possibly
<ce>  express my relief that you chose
<ce>  Wayrest above all other parties.
<ce>  You shall hereafter be known a hero
<ce>  of the land of Wayrest, and I am
<ce>  pleased to present to you the Warlock's Ring
<ce>  and the Staff of Magnus. Well done!"
