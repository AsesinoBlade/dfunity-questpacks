    Misc other ideas:

    Mages Guild: The guild wants to win over a local noble for the sake of a new guild hall in the region. The PC will take an enchanted object to the ruler as a gift. (Rank 1+)

    Mages Guild: The city is suffering from attacks by the undead and the noble has asked the guild to investigate and resolve it or suffer censure. The enemy mage causing it is within a local home, which can be found by asking for rumors. Undead will spawn within the city until the quest is resolved. (Rank 5+)

    Mages Guild: A daedric artifact has been divined in a home in a regional city. The owner appears to be a cloaked mage but is an ancient lich, who requests a favor from the PC in exchange for the artifact. The PC can refuse and kill the lich instead to retrieve the artifact from the corpse. (Rank 8+)

    Mages Guild: A daedra summoning witch has been located in a home in a regional city. The PC must eliminate this unauthorized practitioner to ensure the public’s safety. (Rank 5+)

    Mages Guild: The Guild has heard rumors concerning an object or place called the Mantellan Crux, and several scholars are vying for information on it. The PC must find a scholar in the region who would be willing to shed some light on the topic, likely for a bribe of gold. (Rank 4+)

    Mages Guild quest: The Guild requests that the character eliminate an atronach with a puzzling new characteristic planted in an innocent citizen's home. The creature will multiply itself in two upon death repeatedly, and the character must endure to its final death. (Rank 3+)

    Mages Guild quest: The guild has been troubled by the recent malicious campaign of a former member. Using a variety of illusion spells, he/she has attacked various people and groups out in the wilderness, and must be stopped. The character is sent to a dungeon to find this enemy, but it will be impossible to know what form he/she has taken until found. (Rank 3+)

    Mages Guild quest: A mid-level Mages Guild quest could send the character to terminate a known Necromancer in a residence of another town. When the first hit on the enemy is struck, several undead could be summoned (skeletons, wraiths, etc) to attack the character. (Rank 4+)

    Fighters Guild: The Guild has heard of a weapons master in the region whose expertise could be a benefit. The PC must go into a dungeon to find the master and request his/her help. (Rank 3+)

    Fighters Guild quest: The guild has been hired to resolve a series of murders occurring in and around a shop within the city. Some hint is given that the current shopkeeper may be a daedra or daedra accomplice using illusion spells. (Rank 5+)

    Fighters Guild quest: For the last twenty-four hours the city has had a rash of attacks by atronachs or gargoyles within various stores. After eliminating the threat within one building, the character will be informed by courier to move on to another location, and so on for up to six buildings within a period of forty-eight hours.

    Thieves Guild: The PC must enter a heavily guarded palace in the region and steal away a noble’s child to broker a black market trade. (Rank 6+)

    Knight quest: Orcs in the region are planning an assassination on a noble. The character must reach a palace in the region and wait there during the nighttime for three Orc Sergeants or otherwise leveled Orcs. Similar to Mage's Guild night watch quest. (Rank 5+)

    Knightly Order quest: News has spread throughout the region of a nest of dragonlings within a dungeon of a certain breed that the monarch wishes to protect. The Order has been requested to send a skilled knight to the dungeon to slay any poachers who enter, but not kill any of the dragonlings. (Rank 4+)

    Knightly Order quest: The character is asked to voluntarily accept a magicka-obliterating curse from a wizard who has suffered from it for several months. The character may end the curse by going into a dungeon and destroying the lich who cast it. Magicka will remain at zero until that time. (Rank 6+)

    Riddle quest: A miscellaneous quest could let the character answer five trivia questions about the Iliac Bay or other facets of Daggerfall life. Success TBD. If the character fails, a curse is put on the character, with such negative outcomes as causing a hostile imp or werewolf to appear near the character every six hours for a few days or being followed by Grizzly Bears for ten days, teleporting the character into a random dungeon or directly in front of Medora Direnni, losing 10 luck permanently, or contracting the Plague. If there's a Jester faction of some kind that would probably be most appropriate as questgiver.

    Innkeeper quest: Some months ago the merchant failed a serious obligation/desecrated a memorial and is now haunted by skeletons. The character is asked to accompany the merchant to a dungeon, where he/she can right the wrong and end the matter. Skeletons will appear periodically while the merchant is with the character.

    Merchant quest (over level 5): When spoken to, a merchant/innkeeper offers you a cup of tea made of certain special ingredients. The greater chance is that the character's health and stamina are fully restored at no cost. The lesser chance is that the character blacks out and wakes up at a quest location inside a regional dungeon (similar to An Unexpected Journey quest), with a note asking for forgiveness, as there were threats being made against the merchant's family if he/she did not cooperate.

    Noble quest: Certain debts the noble considers illegitimate are required by a particularly noxious band of collectors. The noble requests that you meet the collectors and either eliminate them or pay the sum out of your own pocket.

    Noble quest: The ruler requests your aid in dispossessing a rural home of its current owner, as a previous agreement has not been honored.

    Noble quest: The Dark Brotherhood has failed in making a certain person disappear, and now both the would-be assassin and the target must be eliminated.

    Noble quest: The noble's child has been offered a piece of jewelry as a birthday gift from another noble, but it appears suspicious. In the role of a courier you will accept the item and test any curse it contains on yourself before delivering it.

    Over level 20 quest: A jester challenges you to retrieve a statue from within a dungeon. For the duration of the challenge, the character's health will be 1, but will have immunity to all spells.

    *****

    I'll include ideas for WA quests here.

    Outside/anywhere: 1. You see a traveling merchant being accosted by a pair of brigands. 2. You hear a voice but don't see the source. "I need your money more than you do. Just 500/1500/2000, that's all I ask."

    Outside/anywhere/night: 1. You hear a soft whispering in your ear, demanding vengeance for its death at the hands of paid assassins.

    Outside/town/daylight: 1. You hear a shopkeeper calling nearby, "Thief! Somebody stop him!" 2. An older man in worn clothes approaches and asks for a loan to pay his debts, promising to pay you back in a few weeks if you meet him in another town. 3. A hooded spellcaster proclaims, "This city and its citizens will bow to my power! Send forth your greatest champion, and I will fell him to the earth!" 4. A distraught voice calls out, "Do none of you care about my missing child?! Help me find him/her, please!" 5. You hear a lively voice call out, "Welcome one and all, and how wonderful it is to see you! Today, and only today, here in this glorious city of [city] I've come to offer free samples of my famous, fabulous, fanatically popular Miracle Elixir! You've all heard the stories from throughout the Iliac Bay of what wonders my potions can do! Try it, find out for yourselves! Who's brave enough to be the first to try this wonderful, unforgettable elixir?!" 6. A courier hands you and others a small leaflet. "The Bank of [region] offers a reward for recovering certain records that were recently stolen. Inquire with [NPC] in the Bank of [region] in [city] for more information." 7. A masked figure draws near, stating that a group of criminals wants to hire you to help rob a local shop at night. 8. The innkeeper quest regarding a false accusation of a jewel ("Are you [name]? The [race]?) could be made an ambient quest. 9. You hear some shouting around the corner. A hooded figure runs into view, briefly stopping next to you. "The heat's on me. Take this jewel and find me in [building] tomorrow. Good pay."

    Outside/wilderness: 1. A cloaked figure draws near haltingly and speaks to you in a whisper. "Please, listen to me. My name is [name], and I am, or was, one of the lords of this region. My brother has betrayed me and declared me an outlaw, and now every guard in [region] watches to throw me into prison or end my life. I can prove my innocence if you will only take me to Palace in [town] and promise me that no guard will see my face." 2. A youth moves close and speaks in hushed tones. "Good [race], my name is [name]. I need your help and your ironclad confidence. I am the son of Lord [name], one of the greater lords of this region. I've plotted to fake my own kidnapping and receive the ransom payment from my father, and then abscond to some corner of Tamriel where he may never find me. However, I require a partner to collect the payment, with whom I will split half the gold. Will you be my champion in this endeavor?"

    Outside/wilderness/night: 1. A soft rustling is your only clue that others are nearby. A few feet away, someone says, "My friends and I would be happy to relieve you of all that heavy gold. You wouldn't want to take a chance with a group like us, would you?"

    Outside/wilderness/storm: 1. A voice booms forth from the clouds. "Why, hello there, young child! Splendid to see a fine [race] such as yeself crawling across the earth, looking for entertainment! Entertainment, says you? I quite agree, there's always room for entertainment in that square skull of thine, is it not? And my near and dear kindred whisper that some hovel called [city] is just filled to the brim with daedra, looking for a partner for the next dance! What says the [race]? Will you dance? Have thou the life of a good party in you?"

    Inside/dungeon: 1. You feel a tap on your shoulder from an injured adventurer who needs an escort to his home town. 2. You see a shimmer in the dim light, accompanied by a voice out of thin air: "Drop all your money or this blade goes through that armor." 3. You hear someone being chased by something dangerous nearby, but you likely won't be detected unless you intervene.

    "I've got a walking problem. There's a plant there, and I just kind of ate him. Well, I didn't eat him. My pet dragon did. There's a bat that looks like a parrot, at least, according to a buddy of mine. This is how you can tell if your kids are taking drugs, is, just measure the swollenness of their head, basically. I have no way of defending myself against this onslaught of rats. Come on, drink some lava, pet dragon. You know you want to grow up and be large and nimble, and the best way to do that is to drink magma." The Great Dimensional Rift

I managed to avoid endangering myself and loved ones!" 48th and one of 47th

    "Do larger eyes make you see better? I don't know. Do larger eyes make you see better? Because, I mean, would you see bigger? What are the results of having eyes more or less large? That's a part of biology I don't know. I'm hopeful that someone who's knowledgeable about that is gonna give us some form of an answer." 8th place
