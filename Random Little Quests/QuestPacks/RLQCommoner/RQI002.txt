<ce>              "Hi there. I recently picked up this book
<ce>        about some of that magic, Mysticism. I've been turning
<ce>       the pages and trying to understand it, but don't really
<ce>         get the whole picture. Are you the kind who'd teach
<ce>                      me about some Mysticism?"
<ce>
<ce>                    (SKILL CHECK: Mysticism, difficulty high)

<ce>                    "That's okay. Take care now."

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               You offer to help. You open the book and

<ce>             The book is more advanced than you expected,
<ce>            but still well within your field of expertise.
<ce>      This =qgiver_ is quite entertained with your explanations.
<ce>           Previously mysterious concepts become lucid with
<ce>             your explanations. It takes awhile, but you
<ce>                manage to answer all of %g3 questions.
<ce>
<ce>              "Well I'll be. This was quite a surprise!
<ce>           I'm sorry I don't have more to pay you with, but
<ce>        I sure am glad you took the time. Have a bit of coin!"

<ce>
<ce>     The book is quite advanced, more than you expected it to be.
<ce>         Talk of teleportation, conjuration, obfuscation, and
<ce>       many other subjects are outside your ability to explain.
<ce>         The =qgiver_ is disappointed that you don't seem to
<ce>             know the material any better than %g1 does.
<ce>                A few frustrating minutes pass before
<ce>               %g1 decides it isn't worth the trouble.
