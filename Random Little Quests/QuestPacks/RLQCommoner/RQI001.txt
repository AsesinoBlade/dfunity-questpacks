<ce>                 "Hey there %ra! Wanna try your hand?
<ce>             We're having fun skinning some apples here,
<ce>         and we're trying to see who's the fastest of us all.
<ce>                              Want in?"

<ce>       They offer you a small knife and hold a couple of apples
<ce>              at the ready. At their signal, you begin.

<ce>            If they were hoping for a show, they got one.
<ce>             Your skill with knives far surpasses theirs.
<ce>                  They watch with wonder as the skin
<ce>         peels cleanly off the apples. After you're finished,
<ce>          they hoop and laugh among themselves. The =qgiver_
<ce>                 then pulls out some money and says,
<ce>
<ce>               "Well by %god, wasn't that entertaining!
<ce>           Have yourself some money. We'd love to see that
<ce>                       when we do this again!"

<ce>
<ce>     You grab the knife and try hard to meet their expectations.
<ce>          Your hands and your mind don't agree on the task,
<ce>        and you find a couple of new gashes on your fingers in
<ce>          your haste to beat their record. Unimpressed, they
<ce>          give you some dull thanks and change the subject.
