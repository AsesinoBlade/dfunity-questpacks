<ce>  Murmurs and chuckles rise from a few rubberneckers
<ce>  who see you advance. You place two hands
<ce>  under the wagon's frame, lift with your legs,
<ce>  and astonish the sparse crowd with
<ce>  a display of well-trained strength.
<ce>  Cheers and applause rise, and the very grateful
<ce>  merchant offers you a pair of potions from
<ce>  his stock to compensate your effort.

<ce>      A loud neigh grabs the attention of
<ce>      the passers by. Rain has turned dirt to mud,
<ce>      sinking one merchant's wagon in the deep.
<ce>      Several villagers attempt to help it out,
<ce>      but soon tire and leave. You can try
<ce>      to pull it out, though you would do so alone.
<ce>      Do you make the attempt?

<ce>  If you fell short, the result could be quite embarrassing.
<ce>  Surely someone else can figure this out.

<ce>  Murmurs and chuckles rise from a few rubberneckers
<ce>  who see you advance. You place two hands
<ce>  under the wagon's frame, lift with your legs,
<ce>  and feel a wrenching pain roll through your back.
<ce>  Your arms and legs burn, and the
<ce>  wagon fails to lift by even a millimeter.
<ce>  The laughter turns raucuous. You depart
<ce>  before anything more humiliating occurs.
