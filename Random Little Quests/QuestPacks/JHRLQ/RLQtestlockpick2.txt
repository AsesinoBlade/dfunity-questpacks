<ce>                   (SKILL CHECK PASSED: Lockpicking)
<ce>
<ce>      You offer to give it a try, and they hesitantly step aside.
<ce>      The magic wards on the box resist the Open spell, so you
<ce>      jimmy it open. Though they're slightly suspicious about how
<ce>      you obtained such skills, they put aside their concerns
<ce>      and offer you a Cure Disease potion from their own bag.

Message:  1010
<ce>      A pair of the %rt's servants are inspecting a locked box
<ce>      a few paces away. They mutter to each other about seized evidence,
<ce>      magic shielding, and an upcoming court trial,
<ce>      but can't get the thing open. If you lend a hand,
<ce>      perhaps a reward would be yours. Do you try to unlock it?

Message:  1011
<ce>  Even if you unlocked it, you could suffer false accusation.
<ce>  You give these government officials a wide berth.

<ce>                   (SKILL CHECK FAILED: Lockpicking)
<ce>
<ce>      You offer to give it a try, and they hesitantly step aside.
<ce>      The magic wards on the box resist the Open spell, so you attempt
<ce>      to jimmy it open. Seconds turn to minutes. Their patience
<ce>      wears thin. They take the box back and bark at you
<ce>      to head elsewhere.
