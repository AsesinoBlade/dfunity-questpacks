<ce>  (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>  
<ce>      You lean in and make a cursory attempt.
<ce>      The issue turns out to be elementary,
<ce>      and dispelling the effect takes no effort
<ce>      on your part. The cat mewls loudly, provoking
<ce>      a relieved hug from its young owner.
<ce>      Lacking a proper payment, the young man
<ce>      offers you a few alchemical ingredients
<ce>      from the family storage before departing.

Message:  1010
<ce>      A youth approaches, explaining that he
<ce>      made a minor mistake with a spellcrafting assignment,
<ce>      and now the family cat is silenced. The feline rests
<ce>      in his arms, hoping for a rapid cure to its ailment.
<ce>      Some latent magicka still persists, and you
<ce>      could try to alter the enchantment if
<ce>      you knew about the subject. Will you try?
<ce>      
<ce>      (SKILL CHECK: MYSTICISM, difficulty: medium)

Message:  1011
<ce>  You refuse, washing your hands of it.
<ce>  Surely there are doctors or magicians for this.

Message:  1012
<ce>               (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>  
<ce>      You lean in and make a cursory attempt.
<ce>      Whatever you tried was not well-guided,
<ce>      for the cat teleports several feet from you.
<ce>      The young man glares at you and tells you to go away
<ce>      before departing with his prized pet.
