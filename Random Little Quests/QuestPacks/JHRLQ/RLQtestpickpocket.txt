<ce>  
<ce>  You keep a short distance, make sure the fog
<ce>  covers you well, and lean in for a quick swipe
<ce>  as the villager's foot falls. He utterly
<ce>  failed to notice the loss of his _gem_.
<ce>  It's all yours now.

Message:  1010
<ce>  Not far in the distance, a well-dressed villager
<ce>  reads a document while walking in the fog.
<ce>  He has carelessly left a prized _gem_ on
<ce>  his person, which a skilled thief could liberate.
<ce>  Do you make the attempt?

<ce>  (SKILL CHECK: Pickpocket, difficulty: low)

<ce>  (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>  
<ce>  You try to make an inconsipcuous effort of it,
<ce>  and your movement is barely too obvious.
<ce>  The villager secures the _gem_, shouts in a panic,
<ce>  and flees. The town guards quickly clue in
<ce>  to your attempt.
