<ce>        Three hours of shooting arrows feels like a long time.
<ce>       At least you didn't spend any munitions of your own.
<ce>       You take a much-needed rest at the end of the
<ce>       training session for your sore arms,
<ce>       and reflect on what knowledge you gained here.

<ce> A dedicated archery trainer stands resolutely in the snow.
<ce> Targets are carefully positioned at different distances,
<ce> each marked by sturdy posts. Bows, some showing signs of use,
<ce> others well-cared for, rest above the snow-covered ground.
<ce> Bundled warmly in furs, the trainer observes nearby students
<ce> with a watchful eye.
<ce> 
<ce> Will you join a three-hour archery class for 350 gold?

Message:  1011
<ce>         Though there is much to learn here, the lesson will
<ce>             have to be for someone else. You move on.

Message:  1012
<ce>            You search among your pockets
<ce>                   but do not find 350 gold pieces.
<ce>         The class begins without you.
