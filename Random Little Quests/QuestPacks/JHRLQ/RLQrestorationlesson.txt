<ce>  They ask 150 gold pieces per participant.
<ce>  Will you join the lesson?

<ce>  The people crowd in without you and begin
<ce>  to listen to the instruction. As for you,
<ce>  you have other places to be.

<ce>  Unfortunately, you don't have 150 gold coins
<ce>  to hand in. The acolytes politely turn toward
<ce>  the other attendees and begin the lesson.

Message:  1013
<ce>  Their numbers and experience lead to a fruitful
<ce>  discussion concerning the uses and methods
<ce>  of Restoration magic. The beginners and intermediate
<ce>  casters in the crowd are quite pleased, and others
<ce>  are simply amused by the magic show at work.
<ce>  After a few hours have passed, the group packs
<ce>  up and heads off to rest.
