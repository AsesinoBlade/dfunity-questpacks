<ce>  (ATTRIBUTE CHECK PASSED)
<ce>  
<ce>  You come close and offer some assistance to the mage,
<ce>  who gratefully accepts it. Decoding the message
<ce>  is quite difficult, but you lead the way and
<ce>  show the result: your momentary companion
<ce>  is being promoted to a new rank upon
<ce>  reading the message.
<ce>
<ce>  "Eureka! A thousand thanks to you, %ra.
<ce>  Do you know the Mages Guild? I'll tell them
<ce>  about you when I return to the hall.
<ce>  Surely you'd have a place with them."

<ce> Are you familiar with the Mages Guild?
<ce>   I'll be sure to mention you
<ce> to them when I get back to the hall.
<ce> You'd certainly find a place among them."

Message:  1010
<ce>  A middle-aged figure wearing well-pressed robes
<ce>  reads a parchment, not far from you.
<ce>  He appears to have difficulty decoding a message
<ce>  given to him by the Mages Guild, for the reason
<ce>  that they intentionally withheld the cypher.
<ce>  He seems to be in over his head.
<ce>  Do you try to help him out?

Message:  1011
<ce>  This would likely require time that you don't have.
<ce>  You move on.

Message:  1015
<ce>  (ATTRIBUTE CHECK FAILED)
<ce>  
<ce>  You come close and offer some assistance to the mage,
<ce>  who gratefully accepts it. Decoding the message
<ce>  is quite difficult, more than you expected.
<ce>  You spend thirty minutes working on it and
<ce>  fail to unravel anything meaningful.
<ce>  The mage is polite but frank, telling you
<ce>  there's no time to waste with mere good intentions.
