<ce>        (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>  
<ce>      You hail the farmer and offer your aid.
<ce>      Your skill shines through, and the animal
<ce>      responds rapidly to the healing spell.
<ce>      Her owner cheers loudly and promises to tell
<ce>      the townspeople of your good character.
<ce>      You don't receive a material reward, but
<ce>      a charitable word on your behalf can go far.

Message:  1010
<ce>      A farmer with a rather sickly-looking cow
<ce>      trudges along, mentioning to a nearby friend that
<ce>      the animal has taken a rather serious illness
<ce>      and needs help. The cause appears to be unnatural
<ce>      which he blames on daedra, witches, his mother-in-law,
<ce>      and sundry other sources.
<ce>      If you knew what you were doing, perhaps a
<ce>      quick spell could resolve the cow's affliction.
<ce>      Do you attempt it?
<ce>      
<ce>      (SKILL CHECK: RESTORATION, difficulty: medium)

Message:  1011
<ce>  You keep aside and let the farmer pursue a cure.

Message:  1012
<ce>               (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>  
<ce>      You hail the farmer and offer your aid.
<ce>      You attempt with your knowledge
<ce>      of restoration magic, causing the cow to
<ce>      feel sleepy and sluggish. Her owner pushes
<ce>      you aside and threatens to call the town watch
<ce>      if you try something like that again.
<ce>      He leads her away in a huff.
