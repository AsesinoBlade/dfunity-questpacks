<ce>                   (SKILL CHECK PASSED: Lockpicking)
<ce>
<ce>      You quietly approach and offer assistance. They're startled,
<ce>      but take your word and step aside. You feel the lock out
<ce>      and turn it apart from the inside. They whisper with wonder
<ce>      and pull out some documents and receipts, useless to you
<ce>      but valuable to their employer. One of them hands
<ce>      you a Potion of Invisibility and promises to put in
<ce>      a good word with the Thieves Guild.

Message:  1010
<ce>      Quiet movement nearby breaks the still of the night.
<ce>      You see some figures hunched over an object, unaware
<ce>      someone observes them. They seem to have gotten
<ce>      a locked chest from a nearby house, but
<ce>      their burglar bailed on them. If you're confident in
<ce>      your lockpicking skill, perhaps you could earn a reward.

Message:  1011
<ce>  You refuse to get involved. There are no town guards to call for,
<ce>      and doing business with strangers can be tricky.

Message:  1012
<ce>                   (SKILL CHECK FAILED: Lockpicking)
<ce>
<ce>      You quietly approach and offer assistance. They're startled,
<ce>      but take your word and step aside. Your best efforts
<ce>      are beaten by the lock, and they grow restless.
<ce>      
<ce>      "Hey, this is a set up, innit? We're about ta ambushed!"
<ce>      
<ce>      One of the thieves is overcome by fear and runs away with the chest.
<ce>      The other pulls out a knife to cut you down.
