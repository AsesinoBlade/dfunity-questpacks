<ce>
<ce>       You and the other contestants grab hold of the ropes
<ce>       above. Minutes pass, with all others falling.
<ce>     You maintain your grip with ease, earning whispered
<ce>     praise from several of the bystanders, as well
<ce>     as a potion for curing poisons.

Message:  1010
<ce>         Seeking entertainment, some of the local villagers have
<ce>      set up a competitive game nearby. Several poles rise in
<ce>      the air with ropes between them, and contestants will
<ce>      hold on as long as they can withstand.
<ce>      The last one to let go will receive
<ce>      a Potion of Cure Poison. One spot remains,
<ce>      if you want to join in.

Message:  1011
<ce>  This would appear to take a while, and you prefer not to spend the time.

<ce>
<ce>        You and the other contestants grab hold of the ropes
<ce>       above. Minutes pass, with several people falling.
<ce>       Your burning arms fail you, causing you to hit the ground with
<ce>       a thud. The potion will go to someone else today.
