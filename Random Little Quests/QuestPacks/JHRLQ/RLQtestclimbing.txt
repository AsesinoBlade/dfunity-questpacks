<ce>                   (SKILL CHECK PASSED: CLIMBING)
<ce>
<ce>         Predictably, this is no ordinary climbing pole.
<ce>    Your hands meet the first few rungs, slickened with oil.
<ce>    A lesser climber would fall immediately, but your skill
<ce>    prevails. The shyster's face twists with disgust
<ce>    as you light off the pole with your new _mitem_.

<ce>         A huckster shows up and plants some kind of climbing pole
<ce>         into the wet ground, with an enchanted _mitem_ at the top.
<ce>         He claims that anyone with the ability to reach it
<ce>         will be its new owner, but will only allow one attempt
<ce>         per person. The rain will likely make the climb
<ce>         more difficult than usual. Will you try?

<ce>  You move on and ignore the diversion. Shortly after,
<ce>  the nearby crowd roars as a contestant claims the _mitem_.

<ce>
<ce>         Predictably, this is no ordinary climbing pole.
<ce>    Your hands meet the first few rungs, slickened with oil.
<ce>    In spite of your best efforts, you fall flat on your back
<ce>    and suffer minor injuries. When other contestants fail to appear,
<ce>     the charlatan picks up the pole and hurries off
<ce>    to somewhere more populated.
