<ce>              So, like, I've got a problem. Maybe not a
<ce>              problem, but an issue. Got someone coming
<ce>               into the guild hall asking for help with
<ce>               some weird request every few hours, and
<ce>               it's been going on for days now. Problem
<ce>               is, I can't wrap my head around what I'm
<ce>              being asked. All I get is that it's gonna
<ce>                 take someone with skill like yours.
<ce>                I really don't know what it's offering
<ce>               or nothing but I think it'd lead to some
<ce>               adventure like we don't see around here.
<ce>                     Wanna get this off my back?

<ce>                 Aw, all right. I should know better
<ce>                than to offer a job without a reward.

<ce>             Hey, I wasn't expecting that. Hold on a sec,
<ce>             lemme get out what I wrote about the thing.

<ce>             By the way, just so you know, I'm giving you
<ce>             points just for signing up for this. You're
<ce>                really reaching your neck out for me.

Message:  1010
<ce>               Hey, sorry I'm gonna be busy for awhile.
<ce>                 Come back in a few hours, all right?
