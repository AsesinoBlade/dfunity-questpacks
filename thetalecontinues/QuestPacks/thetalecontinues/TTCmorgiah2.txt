<ce>   Safe within Castle Wayrest, Morgiah calmly begins
<ce>   tying her hair. She speaks.
<ce>   
<ce>   "%pcf, you said you could keep a secret.
<ce>   I believe you. And if you ever tell anyone
<ce>   what those witches fabricated,
<ce>   you will die alone and in agony."
<ce>   
<ce>   She turns to look you in the eye.
<ce>   
<ce>   "Understood?"
<ce>   
<ce>   Then she hands you an amulet.
<ce>   
<ce>   "Eadwyre gave me this when he married my mother.
<ce>   He said it was a cherished gift for a cherished daughter,
<ce>   whatever that means. I don't want it anymore,
<ce>   and I'm giving it to you. I hope it's more useful
<ce>   to you than it was to me."
<ce>   
<ce>   She takes a few steps toward the royal court,
<ce>   and then turns back to you.
<ce>   
<ce>   "I'm sorry. You saw the worst of me in Menevia.
<ce>   Please, don't look down on me."
<ce>   
<ce>   She closes her eyes, holding back a sob.
<ce>   
<ce>   "I miss my father."
<ce>   
<ce>   She then turns away and takes her place on the royal dais.

<ce>  The princess is taken aback by the sight before her.
<ce>  She takes it all in.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Thank you... thank you all for making this
<ce>  possible for me. I, um, look forward to what will happen."
<ce>  
<ce>  Morgian crosses her arms and gestures with one hand.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Okay. I'm ready. Show me my father."
<ce>  
<ce>  The head witch begrudgingly sets various
<ce>  organs on the floor, as well as the emerald.
<ce>  They all join together in a slow and
<ce>  laborious enchantment that makes the
<ce>  air around you grow warmer. Your eyes
<ce>  sting and your hair stands up.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Come forth... Come forth, Symmachus of Almalexia!
<ce>  Come forth, Symmachus, son of Morgiah!
<ce>  Come forth, Symmachus! Come forth!"
<ce>  
<ce>  They set the organs ablaze, and an ethereal
<ce>  figure appears in the smoke. A Dark Elf,
<ce>  unusually tall and broad, towers over the
<ce>  gathered crowd. He seems to be wearing
<ce>  a set of armor with a sheathed sword.
<ce>  
<ce>  Morgiah looks up at him, between awe and pain.
<ce>  You hear a tinge of regret as she speaks.
<ce>  
<ce>  "F-Father? It's you. Isn't it? I... I have news for you."
<ce>  
<ce>  The apparition pauses, and then clutches its head.
<ce>  It groans loudly before releasing a roar.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Morgiah... Morgian, my daughter, why have
<ce>  you done it? The firstborn... You have..."
<ce>  
<ce>  His daughter looks wounded, and then her eyes
<ce>  flare up when she recovers.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I did exactly what you wanted me to!
<ce>  I'm going to be a queen! Have you no
<ce>  understanding of what I'll sacrifice to
<ce>  meet YOUR vision for ME?"
<ce>  
<ce>  The figure of Symmachus wails to the sky.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Morgiah, why... how... I never...
<ce>  You weren't supposed to..."
<ce>  
<ce>  The princess raises both arms in exasperation.
<ce>  
<ce>  "What, were we supposed to return to Mournhold?!
<ce>  You think I could ever become a queen there?
<ce>  You are DELUSIONAL! Our family can't go back
<ce>  to Morrowind! Ever! Okay?!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The image of her father finally reaches a calm.
<ce>  But the quet is born of regret, not of
<ce>  reconciliation. With a weeping voice,
<ce>  he announces,
<ce>  
<ce>  "I will have an heir on the throne of Mournhold.
<ce>  But it will not be you. Go to the far-off land
<ce>  of Summerset. You have cursed your son.
<ce>  Misery and obscurity will await you."
<ce>  
<ce>  The smoke regains its form, and Symmachus disappears.
<ce>  Morgiah flies into a rage.
<ce>  
<ce>  "What in Oblivion was that?! Is this some kind of trick?"
<ce>  
<ce>  She points at the witches as her voice rises.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Who of you manipulated that? Who was it? SAY IT!
<ce>  Tell me who made that false vision of my father!
<ce>  That was not him! TELL ME!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The witches stand in silence, partially for their dignity
<ce>  and partially for fear of offending the
<ce>  princess of Wayrest. Finally, the Dark Elf
<ce>  glowers at them and stands back.
<ce>  
<ce>  "You're lucky I don't tell my mother to send
<ce>  a legion to burn this hovel to the ground.
<ce>  Nobody should have to put up with the
<ce>  lies you people spread."
<ce>  
<ce>  Lastly, she turns away.
<ce>  
<ce>  "%pcf, we have to return to Wayrest.
<ce>  I long for dignified surroundings once more."
