<ce>  Gortwog chuckles when he sees you
<ce>  return with Mynisera's certficiate.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Ah, Wayrest. More predictable
<ce>  than they are sly. I knew they would
<ce>  refuse. This was a lesson to you,
<ce>  not to me, %ra."
<ce>  
<ce>  He calls for a servant, who produces
<ce>  a well-oiled blade wrapped in a cloth.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I will keep the document myself,
<ce>  for I have hopes for the day when
<ce>  an orc will enter a Breton city
<ce>  with the rights of an imperial citizen.
<ce>  Perhaps even I would travel to
<ce>  Daggerfall myself and tell this
<ce>  dowager queen of my thanks to her.
<ce>  
<ce>  "As for you, a reward is meet.
<ce>  A champion of mine recently fell
<ce>  in battle, and his kin refuse to
<ce>  take up his sword. With their
<ce>  permission, I grant it to you instead."

Message:  1010
<ce>   A messenger bearing the crest of the
<ce>   Knights of the Dragon hands you a letter.
<ce>   
<ce>   "%pcn, right? This is for your eyes only."
<ce>
<ce>  He then departs.

Message:  1011
To %pcn
<ce> 
  Forgive my intrusion upon your time. If you
find yourself engrossed in important matters,
I understand and will hold nothing against you.
Were you able to visit Castle Daggerfall,
I have a favor to ask, one that weighs on
my soul heavily.
<ce> 
              Mynisera
              Dowager Queen of Daggerfall

Message:  1012
<ce>  Thank you for coming. I admit I had my doubts
<ce>  as to whether you would respond, and I feel
<ce>  great relief in light of that mistake.
<ce>  
<ce>  Are you headed east any time soon?
<ce>  I have a letter that I wish to send to
<ce>  Orsinium. None of Daggerfall's messengers
<ce>  are scheduled for that region in this season,
<ce>  and I feel some urgency regarding it.
<ce>  Are you able to do this?

Message:  1013
<ce>  Thank you. Here is the letter. I wish to request...
<ce>  that Gortwog read it in private. Please do not
<ce>  misunderstand. I don't distrust you, I merely
<ce>  wish to leave the past in the past. I pray
<ce>  that he understand my intention, and
<ce>  even believe me as well.
<ce>  
<ce>  Please deliver it to him intact.
<ce>  There is no need to return to me or tell
<ce>  me of the act. I have confidence in you.

%qdt:
 Mynisera, mother of Gothryd, gave me
 a letter to deliver to Gortwog of ___orsinium_.
 She couldn't tell me what was in it or
 what purpose it has.

Message:  1016
<ce>  "Yes? What purpose has summoned you here?"
<ce>  
<ce>  You offer Mynisera's letter to the orc.
<ce>  He looks at it and pauses.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I will know of its contents, but
<ce>  not read it myself. Shaman."
<ce>  
<ce>  One of his servants enters the room
<ce>  and takes the paper from you.
<ce>  Breaking the seal and unfurling
<ce>  the parchment within, the shaman
<ce>  reads its contents aloud with
<ce>  surprisingly fluent enunciation.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Dear Gortwog, king of the orcs.
<ce>  In my previous letter, I indicated I would
<ce>  support the cause of the orcish nation.
<ce>  I know Lysandus would have wished for this,
<ce>  but I have reasons I wish to expound,
<ce>  now that I bring this matter to its conclusion.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I do not know to what extent you
<ce>  remember a Prince Klaius of the Bretons,
<ce>  several decades past. I know of the many
<ce>  offenses your people have suffered from
<ce>  the imperial nations, but surely his acts
<ce>  stand out among others. Hosts of
<ce>  orcish peasants, women and children,
<ce>  were slaughtered by his command.
<ce>  His barbarism was equaled only by
<ce>  his gaiety in telling of carcass counts
<ce>  and smoking huts, of displaced peoples
<ce>  who did him no harm.
<ce>  
<ce>  "My quill shakes as I write this, for
<ce>  I am grieved to be associated with such
<ce>  acts. He was my father. I had
<ce>  neither age, wisdom, nor standing
<ce>  to stop him. But I am an heir to his legacy,
<ce>  and the misery he inflicted on others
<ce>  has cast a shadow upon me.
<ce>  
<ce>  "The gods refuse to hear my petitions to
<ce>  absolve my guilt. I have tried long and hard,
<ce>  and given to more temples than I can count.
<ce>  If they will not hear me, perhaps I must
<ce>  put my hand to the plowshare, as we would say.
<ce>  Enclosed is a certificate for five million gold pieces,
<ce>  written to the name Gortwog gro-Nagorm.
<ce>  Please forgive the paltry amount.
<ce>  I have sold all outstanding properties I possessed,
<ce>  and resigned myself to living upon the
<ce>  castle's resources for the remainder of my days.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Had I means and health to visit you,
<ce>  I would do so myself, and seek penance for
<ce>  that which was, and which must not be.
<ce>  As you read this, I now send a letter
<ce>  to the Emperor, formally requesting
<ce>  a council on behalf of a future orcish nation.
<ce>  
<ce>  "What more I can do than this, I do not know.
<ce>  But if the grave absolves all guilt, I will
<ce>  welcome it.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Mynisera, Dowager Queen, Daggerfall Castle."

Message:  1018
<ce>  The shaman folds the parchment.
<ce>  Gortwog allows a respectful pause.
<ce>  
<ce>  After several moments, he addresses the shaman.
<ce>  They speak in the orcish tongue, which you do
<ce>  not know well enough to interpret.
<ce>  A couple of minutes pass, and the shaman
<ce>  withdraws while Gortwog speaks to you.
<ce>  
<ce>  "This woman's gift is well received. She
<ce>  will know of my gratitude in a future day,
<ce>  in person, were it possible.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I have a lesson for you. Take her certificate
<ce>  to Wayrest. Make an account for
<ce>  the name Gortwog gro-Nagorm. Put the woman's
<ce>  money into it, and report to me.
<ce>  I will await you here."

Message:  1019
<ce>  The shaman folds the parchment.
<ce>  Gortwog allows a respectful pause.
<ce>  
<ce>  After several moments, he addresses the shaman.
<ce>  They speak in the orcish tongue, which you
<ce>  know well enough to interpret.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Poor Mynisera. She carries a guilt which is not her own."
<ce>  
<ce>  "My lord, that money could do us great good.
<ce>  We could build up a storehouse
<ce>  for the destitute. Or perhaps increase our
<ce>  defenses on the south and the west."
<ce>  
<ce>  "A storehouse was my first thought as well.
<ce>  If Septim refuses our request, we must
<ce>  prepare for the winters ahead. Our people
<ce>  need something to raise their spirits."
<ce>  
<ce>  The shaman withdraws while Gortwog speaks to you.
<ce>  
<ce>  "The queen's gift is well received. She
<ce>  will know of my gratitude in a future day,
<ce>  in person, were it possible.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I have a lesson for you. Take her certificate
<ce>  to Wayrest. Make an account for
<ce>  the name Gortwog gro-Nagorm. Put her
<ce>  money into it, and report to me.
<ce>  I will await you here."

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 Gortwog's shaman read aloud the
 contents of Mynisera's letter.
 It included a cheque for five million
 gold pieces in the orc king's name.
 He has sent me to any bank in
 ___wayrest_ to open an account in
 that name, to deposit the money.

Message:  1021
<ce>  You enter the bank and chance upon
<ce>  the proprietor near the entrance.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Hello there! Welcome to the
<ce>  Bank of Wayrest. What can I do for you?"
<ce>  
<ce>  You show him the certificate for
<ce>  Mynisera's gold and the name of the
<ce>  account you wish to open. The banker
<ce>  looks over them, then again, and again.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Ha, ha. This is a joke, isn't it?"
<ce>  
<ce>  Somewhere between smug and proud,
<ce>  the banker shakes his head.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Let me be clear. We do not do business with orcs."
<ce>  
<ce>  He looks you square in the eyes.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I'll repeat that. We do not. Do business.
<ce>  With orcs. No exceptions. Period.
<ce>  Your certificate is worthless. Goodbye."
<ce>  
<ce>  He then returns to his customary place
<ce>  in the bank lobby.

Message:  1022
%qdt:
 My attempt to deliver Mynisera's money
 to an account in Gortwog's name failed.
 The banks in Wayrest refuse to deal
 with ___orsinium_ in any way. If I can do
 no more, I can return it to the orc king.

Message:  1026
<ce>  I am disappointed, but I understand.
<ce>  Already I have imposed upon your time,
<ce>  and a journey to the land of the orcs
<ce>  is not to be undertaken lightly.
<ce>  I hold no offense to your refusal.
<ce>  Safe journeys to you, %pcf.

Message:  1027
<ce>  Mynisera's letter is sealed tight,
<ce>  with no way to look within
<ce>  without leaving evidence of tampering.

Message:  1028
Directed to the Bank of Wayrest
<ce>  
  Upon receipt of this document, the Bank of Wayrest
is directed to withdraw five million (5,000,000)
gold pieces from the Bank of Daggerfall in the name
of Mynisera, Dowager Queen of the kingdom of Daggerfall,
to be given to one Gortwog gro-Nagorm.
<ce>  
This certificate has been ratified by the regional banking
authority, and all questions may be directed to Lady Mynisera.
