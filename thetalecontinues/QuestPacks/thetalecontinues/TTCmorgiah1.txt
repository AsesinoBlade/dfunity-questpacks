<ce>  They accepted? Truly? What joy!
<ce>  Yes, I'm ready to leave. The king
<ce>  has full confidence in you, and
<ce>  the journey isn't far. We'll be
<ce>  back in Wayrest in mere days.
<ce>  Lead on, %pcf!

Message:  1010
<ce>       A strong and tall courier approaches and hands
<ce>       you a letter bearing the seal of Wayrest
<ce>       before departing in dignified silence.

Message:  1011
Dear %pcn,
 
 I thoroughly enjoyed your previous visit to our humble
court. If you're ever in the area, could you make
another visit to the castle? I have a favor to ask of you,
one with a better reward than the last.
We in Wayrest treasure loyalty.
<ce>       
              Yours truly,
              Princess Morgiah of Wayrest

Message:  1012
<ce>  %pcf, it is a pleasure to enjoy your presence
<ce>  once more. I am always thrilled to have
<ce>  a visitor here, especially one with
<ce>  a good reputation, and accomplishments to
<ce>  back it up. Tell me, are you up for an errand?
<ce>  If not, I'm happy to just say hello
<ce>  and leave it at that.

Message:  1013
<ce>  What a delightful answer! Thank you so much for
<ce>  taking me up on it. We have a great many things
<ce>  to discuss, but I'd rather not distract my
<ce>  parents with a long conversation, you understand.
<ce>  Could you follow me outside, to the castle entrance?
<ce>  We can talk there with great liberty.

Message:  1014
<ce>  Morgiah stretches and raises both arms high in the air.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Ahh, this feels nice. It's pretty rare
<ce>  to talk with someone in confidence. I don't know
<ce>  what the other courts in Tamriel are like,
<ce>  but Wayrest is kind of a..."
<ce>  
<ce>  She starts looking for the right word,
<ce>  and then snaps back to reality.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Forgive me, I was about to say something rude.
<ce>  We're not here so I can complain about Wayrest's
<ce>  finest bootlickers, are we?"
<ce>  
<ce>  She leans against the wall and smiles, crossing her arms.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Before I get into the details, I'm going to ask a few questions.
<ce>  First: are you willing to keep any secret I tell you,
<ce>  no matter what it is?"

Message:  1016
<ce>  "Oh, it's good we got that out of the way then.
<ce>  You're being honest, and I appreciate it.
<ce>  I'll have to look for someone else to
<ce>  take up this little errand of mine.
<ce>  But I hope your stay in Warest is long and pleasant!
<ce>  I have to return to the court before
<ce>  my parents start to wonder."
<ce>  
<ce>  Morgiah waves at you before she returns to the castle.

Message:  1017
<ce>  Good! That's a very nice thing to hear.
<ce>  Well, my last favor sent you to meet
<ce>  the King of Worms, who was happy to oblige my
<ce>  request. This time, I need something else,
<ce>  something a little more neutral.
<ce>  You'd have to take just a couple of steps
<ce>  into the occult, to be sure.
<ce>  Is that something you could do?

Message:  1018
<ce>  Oh, you're really spoiling me. Okay then.
<ce>  This is what I'll ask of you. I need witches.
<ce>  
<ce>  I think you can tell that the king of Wayrest
<ce>  is not my father. Mine died when I was barely a girl.
<ce>  His name was, or is, Symmachus. I'd... like to see him again.
<ce>  
<ce>  I can't ask the King of Worms for this favor.
<ce>  Who knows what kind of price he'd demand the second time.
<ce>  I have an alternative. There are witches in Menevia
<ce>  to the northwest who I've heard can do something like this.
<ce>  It's not urgent, but my request is that you find
<ce>  the witch coven in Menevia and ask them whether
<ce>  they can channel a deceased spirit.
<ce>  I'll give you a sack of gold to grease the wheel a bit.
<ce>  I don't know if witches use gold, but it can't hurt.
<ce>  
<ce>  I don't know exactly where the coven is.
<ce>  The rumors I've gotten say that it's
<ce>  west of some place called Hawkton Court,
<ce>  and a little to the north. Look for an open clearing
<ce>  without trees, save a large circle around the witches. 
<ce>  I doubt any roads will lead there, so you may be obliged
<ce>  to undertake some crosscountry travel.
<ce>  
<ce>  If they agree to help, come back and tell me.
<ce>  I would really, really appreciate a positive
<ce>  response on their part, if that's possible at all.
<ce>  A safe journey to you, %pcf.

 Princess Morgiah of Wayrest has asked
 me to travel to Menevia to find a coven
 of witches living in the wilderness.
 She wants to know if they can channel
 the spirit of her dead father.
 Their coven may be to the west
 of Hawkton Court in Menevia,
 and slightly north as well.
 It should be in a large clearing,
 with a circle of trees.
 She gave me a sack of coins as
 a gift to the witches.

Message:  1020
<ce>  Greetings to thee, %ra, and
<ce>  welcome to our wilderness abode.
<ce>  Make known thy desire.
<ce>  
<ce>  Indeed, we of Tamarilyn can call forth
<ce>  the deceased. Many can do this, and so
<ce>  can we. Thy gold we shall take as payment
<ce>  for the vision, but there remaineth one ingredient
<ce>  that is wanting: an emerald, unspotted,
<ce>  clean and whole. If thou wilt bring
<ce>  to pass the princess' desire, an emerald
<ce>  of any provenance shall be thy gift to thy sisters.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 The Tamarilyn coven of Menevia is willing to
 call forth the spirit of Morgiah's father,
 but they require an emerald. It doesn't
 matter where I get it from.

Message:  1022
<ce>  You now have an emerald to serve the witches' purpose.

Message:  1023
<ce>  Ah, thou art come, and thou hast thy
<ce>  gem with thee. Thy gold shall be spent
<ce>  obtaining victuals for the rite.
<ce>  If the princess of Wayrest will see her
<ce>  desired vision, she shall repair to us
<ce>  in very person.
<ce>  
<ce>  Know thou, %ra, that the dead do not
<ce>  take well to disturbances. If this
<ce>  Morgiah will take heed and be wise,
<ce>  she will not antagonize that which
<ce>  must be laid to rest. We shall await
<ce>  the return of ye in coming days.

Message:  1025
%qdt:
 The witches accepted Morgiah's payment
 and the emerald I gave them. I can
 return to them in Menevia with the princess,
 and they will carry out their act.

Message:  1026
<ce>  A finest hello to you then, %pcf.
<ce>  I hope you always feel welcome in Wayrest,
<ce>  and that your next journey will
<ce>  be safe and prosperous.
<ce>  Thank you for coming by.

Message:  1028
<ce>  A woman's voice surrounds you in the air,
<ce>  deep and firm and uninterested.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Seekest thou the witches of Tamarilyn Coven,
<ce>  wandering %ra? Thou art not far. Stand forth
<ce>  before the witch who is head above all
<ce>  others. There shalt thy desire be heard."
