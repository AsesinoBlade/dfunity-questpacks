<ce>  You introduce yourself, and Gortwog smiles broadly.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Welcome, %pcf, to the land of Orsinium!
<ce>  I hope your journey was safe and uneventful."
<ce>  He speaks far more fluently than his messengers did.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Your coming this far shows much greater wisdom than
<ce>  many of the Bretons. Most of them would exterminate
<ce>  my kind, had they the power. Armies led by Eadwyre
<ce>  raid our farms and slay our children. Your Emperor
<ce>  turns a blind eye to our suffering, while pretending
<ce>  he is the god-king of the whole continent.
<ce>  I find in him a coward.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Hear me, %ra. When was it that you last heard
<ce>  an Orcish army burn a settlement of the Bretons?
<ce>  My people are fierce and unruly, yes, but I have never
<ce>  permitted them to slay the innocent. I can control
<ce>  my people. The kings of your lands cannot control theirs.
<ce>  What, then, will happen when the ultimate
<ce>  power reaches their hands?"
<ce>  
<ce>  Gortwog folds his arms and maintains a fixed stare.
<ce>  "I know you are of the few who have heard of the Totem.
<ce>  I do not know where it is, though my people search
<ce>  for it across all lands. The orcs you encounter on
<ce>  your voyages would live and die to put the Totem
<ce>  in my hands. They know I am the only one who acts with
<ce>  restraint and honor. I wish to defend my people and gain
<ce>  the Emperor's ear. The orcs will be equals with the humans!
<ce>  The slaughter of my kin must end! Whether you find the Totem
<ce>  or are merely a messenger for other lords, I put into you
<ce>  my words: Numidium is only safe under me. By any other,
<ce>  this whole land will suffer, and my people will all die.
<ce>  Do not be fooled."
<ce>  
<ce>  He then sighs. "Lastly, forgive my soldiers who attack you.
<ce>  I do not hold you responsible for their deaths. Should they 
<ce>  disobey my orders, they take their lives into their hands.
<ce>  Your self-defense is guiltless."
<ce>  
<ce>  Finally, he bows. "Now go. And take this as a gift
<ce>  of my sincerity, and joy at our meeting."
