<ce>  So you've returned at last. I don't want
<ce>  to know who has the Totem. Perhaps you
<ce>  carry it even now, and think you'll unleash its
<ce>  power on this fallen world upon your return.
<ce>  Much as I wish you could, reactivating Numidium
<ce>  will not be so simple.
<ce>  
<ce>  To regain the machine's heart, I must send you to
<ce>  a different dimensional plane where it resides.
<ce>  I will get you close, but you will yet have a
<ce>  journey to undertake. The heart is a large
<ce>  green gem suspended in the air somewhere
<ce>  in the other plane. You must merely touch it,
<ce>  and it will return you to this tower.

<ce>                    Then speak to me when you are.

 All that's left now is to return to Medora.
 She has something to explain about Numidium's
 power source, and how to get the machine started.

<ce>  After that? It's impossible to say. Perhaps
<ce>  it will spring to life and give its holder
<ce>  power to annihilate. I doubt it. More likely
<ce>  it will take months or even years to fully recover.
<ce>  No one will ever know, except the heart itself.
<ce>  
<ce>  You will be stranded on the other side until
<ce>  you find the heart. Therefore, you must prepare.
<ce>  
<ce>  Are you ready to go?
