<ce>  Ah, the noble %pcn. Welcome, friend.
<ce>  
<ce>  I will admit I had my doubts about you.
<ce>  The last thing Daggerfall needs is more
<ce>  Imperial dogs sniffing about, trying to
<ce>  expose our more sensitive matters.
<ce>  The Emperor is hardly as forthcoming
<ce>  as my father claimed. Perhaps he really
<ce>  is senile.
<ce>  
<ce>  But you are one %ra worthy of praise.
<ce>  Forgive my shortness in speaking, for the
<ce>  city is continually under attack by
<ce>  the Totem's pretended thieves.
<ce>  I will relinquish the Lord's Mail and
<ce>  the Necromancer's Amulet, and hereby
<ce>  proclaim you a hero of all Daggerfall.

Message:  1012
<ce>  You see the remains of a recent battle here.
<ce>  No one wants to risk letting Daggerfall control the totem.

Message:  1013
