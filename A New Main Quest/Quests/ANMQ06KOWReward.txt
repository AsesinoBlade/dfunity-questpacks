<ce>  You are truly a fascinating creature.
<ce>  
<ce>  Few there are who would dare believe
<ce>  the King of Worms, and moreso when
<ce>  the fate of a continent is at stake.
<ce>  What is it you want? Just to get rid
<ce>  of Numidium? Your request shall be granted.
<ce>  Is it power you want? I can give you that
<ce>  as well.
<ce>  
<ce>  Take this soul gem. It's quite special, in truth.
<ce>  Took me some time to make. You'll be able to use it
<ce>  to summon help in battle from the darkness.
<ce>  It takes twenty-four hours to recharge after use,
<ce>  but it powers itself. It will never run out.
<ce>  Clever, isn't it?
<ce>  
<ce>  I wish I had years to teach you what I know
<ce>  out of gratitude, but I don't. Already the humans
<ce>  are trying to invade Scourg Barrow and take
<ce>  the Totem for themselves. They will fail,
<ce>  I assure you. But that soul gem will cost you
<ce>  no learning at all. Use it to your heart's content.
<ce>  Darkness guide your steps, my friend.

 With the Totem out of my hands, I should visit the King of Worms
 before I find the power source of Numidium.
