<ce>  Queen Akorithi calls her entire court to
<ce>  the throne room. In a formal ceremony,
<ce>  every advisor and prince of Sentinel
<ce>  bows down before you in recognition of
<ce>  your status as a hero of the nation.
<ce>  You then kneel before the Queen, who personally
<ce>  grants you your reward. She speaks briefly,
<ce>  
<ce>  "You've already seen how the other powers
<ce>  of Tamriel have begun to invade us.
<ce>  Numidium will be a heavy burden to bear,
<ce>  but bear it we must. It alone is the
<ce>  key to our survival."

Message:  1012
<ce>  You see the remains of a recent battle here.
<ce>  No one wants to risk letting Sentinel control the totem.

Message:  1013
%qdt:
 With the Totem out of my hands, I should visit Queen Akorithi
 before I find the power source of Numidium.
