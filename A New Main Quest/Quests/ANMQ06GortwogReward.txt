<ce>             Gortwog spares no time in bowing himself to
<ce>             the ground at your arrival. He remains there
<ce>             for a full minute in silent, regal splendor.
<ce>                He then rises up and takes your hand.

<ce>         "You shall be known as a friend of the orcs forever.
<ce>            Already my people have started to return home
<ce>              to Orsinium. Our fears of extinction fade
<ce>               like the dark night before the morning.
<ce>            Our lives will be ours once more! Our debt to you
<ce>                    is everlasting, %ra of honor!"
