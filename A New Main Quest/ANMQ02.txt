<ce>                  "Hello there. How can I help you?"
<ce>
<ce>           You show the damaged letter and the place where
<ce>             the Emperor's seal was before being torn up,
<ce>                and explain the events to this point.
<ce>             He takes a sharp glass to peer through, then
<ce>             casts a few spells. After several tests, he
<ce>        seems satisfied. Then he begins to speak in a whisper.
<ce>       A field of silence surrounds the two of you, apparently
<ce>             one of the spells he included while reading.
<ce>
<ce>              "My dear %ra, we are all in grave danger.
<ce>
<ce>            "Very few people know, or knew, the existence
<ce>          of this thing until now. It was presumed destroyed
<ce>        after Tiber Septim used it to dominate this continent
<ce>     and create the now-existing Empire. They called it Numidium,
<ce>       a metal machine hundreds of meters tall that would obey
<ce>        its master's voice like a dog. 'Destroy Elsweyr,' you
<ce>            could say, and it would rush to the genocide.
<ce>          Such potential is horrifying. Whether Tiber Septim
<ce>         used it for good or evil is beyond us at this point.
<ce>        Who can be trusted with such power in this age of war?
<ce>     If no opponent could ever resist you, where would you stop?
<ce>
<ce>      "When you spoke to the queen, did you notice the diplomats
<ce>      from Sentinel and Wayrest in the audience? Lord Provlith,
<ce>       for instance? I cannot doubt he is already sending word
<ce>     to Queen Akorithi by the fastest boat. It cannot be helped.
<ce>          The great powers of High Rock and Hammerfell will
<ce>         now race to gain it for themselves. For the owner of
<ce>            Numidium, no conquest will ever be impossible,
<ce>              even if the united Empire rallied against.
<ce>
<ce>          "Now, why are we surrounded by a field of silence
<ce>          instead of discussing this with the royal family?
<ce>           Because they are as much a danger as Gortwog or
<ce>           the very Underking. Aubk-i is a little girl, and
<ce>           Gothryd loves only himself. I served his father,
<ce>          and cannot in good conscience help this king gain
<ce>        any more power than he has got. I know the difference.
<ce>          Lysandus would have done the right thing. Gothryd
<ce>                         is incapable of it.
<ce>
<ce>            "The spell enveloping us will soon end. I will
<ce>       share with you a few last words. We now know Numidium's
<ce>         location, but not what the 'Totem' is, which is used
<ce>          to control Numidium, nor Numidium's power source.
<ce>        Once they are located, the world will be in an uproar.
<ce>              Know who to trust. Watch people carefully.
<ce>          Numidium must end in the hands of someone. As the
<ce>        Emperor's agent, it is your duty to help whoever will
<ce>   save or spare the people. The future of Tamriel is before you."
<ce>
<ce>     The spell wavers, and soon the uncomfortable vacuum of noise
<ce>       unravels around you. He tries his best to fake a smile.

<ce>           Popudax writes something on a piece of paper and
<ce>           discreetly puts it in your hand when no one else
<ce>          is watching. He then bids you farewell and returns
<ce>                 to his work, trying to calm himself.

Message:  1013
<ce>       Seek out Karethys of Wayrest and Charvek-si of Sentinel.
<ce>                  They are both wise. I trust them.

%qdt:
 Queen Aubk-i asked me to deliver the Emperor's
 damaged letter to Popudax, who should be in
 the Mages Guild of the city of ___mages_.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 Popudax has told me to look for someone named
 Karethys in Wayrest, and someone else
 named Charvek-si in Sentinel. He wants
 me to seek their advice and trust them.

Message:  1022
%qdt:
 I talked to both Karethys and Charvek-si.
 They'll contact me after consorting
 one with another. I'll merely
 have to bide my time until that happens.

Message:  1023
She's the court sorceress of Wayrest. They say Helseth likes her.
<--->
Karethys is one of the Wayrest nobles. You'll find her in the castle behind the partition.
<--->
Karethys is the court sorceress of Wayrest. She stays in the same room as Helseth, with the tables.

Message:  1024
The Sentinel royal healer. She's got private quarters in Sentinel Palace, next to the arboretum.
<--->
Charvek-si's a nice lady. She has a laboratory right next to the arboretum in Sentinel palace.
<--->
Charvek-si's a noble in Sentinel Palace. Go into the arboretum in there and just open some doors, you'll see her.

Message:  1025
%qdt:
 I have met with Karethys and we spoke
 about Numidium and the Totem.
 She says it's a death sentence to carry
 the Totem anywhere, so we need to a plan to avoid that.

Message:  1026
%qdt:
 I have met with Charvek-si.
 She'll prepare some means of coded communication
 for the future. She also suggested I give the
 Underking a chance, as no one else seems to be willing.
