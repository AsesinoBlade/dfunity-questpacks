<ce>                 (ETIQUETTE/PERSONALITY CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>                  You introduce yourself to Nulfaga,
<ce>                   grandmother to King Gothryd and
<ce>                   mother of the deceased Lysandus.
<ce>              You explain your mission from the Emperor
<ce>               and your referral from the royal courts
<ce>               to find help in finding or transporting
<ce>                              the Totem.
<ce>
<ce>                 "Totem? You want a Totem? I'm afraid
<ce>                my coffers are empty unto you, child.
<ce>                 The Emperor has shown me no kindness
<ce>                    since the loss of my son, and
<ce>             I am an exile in this cold, barren fortress.
<ce>          Ask your Emperor for your help, and leave me be."
<ce>
<ce>            Though Nulfaga refuses to help you, it appears
<ce>               she won't force you to leave Shedungent.
<ce>              Maybe there's something here to help you.

<ce>
<ce>                  You introduce yourself to Nulfaga,
<ce>                   grandmother to King Gothryd and
<ce>                   mother of the deceased Lysandus.
<ce>              You explain your mission from the Emperor
<ce>               and your referral from the royal courts
<ce>               to find help in finding or transporting
<ce>                              the Totem.
<ce>
<ce>                 "Well, I've never heard of a Totem.
<ce>             Is it valuable? Will it help keep Daggerfall
<ce>           safe? My spoiled grandson can't run a military.
<ce>            His wizard should be running things, I think.
<ce>
<ce>                  "Well, if you need help moving it,
<ce>               I think one of the treasures here could
<ce>             help. Opens a small portal for a short time.
<ce>                Came from the Thieves Guild, they say.
<ce>                 Can't send a person through, but if
<ce>                  this Totem isn't so big, you could
<ce>                probably throw it through so it could
<ce>                  reach the throne room pretty fair.
<ce>
<ce>             "It's somewhere in this castle, let's see...
<ce>             Northwest? Go out that door to the north and
<ce>                 wrap around to the west, and then...
<ce>                   %oth, I don't remember. But it's
<ce>                  in there somewhere. Go find it and
<ce>                 learn to use it. And tell that brat
<ce>                grandson of mine to respect his elders
<ce>              with a visit now and then, why don't you."

<ce>               This simple-looking wand seems to exude
<ce>               power. You test it on your surroundings,
<ce>                and find that it's capable of opening
<ce>                small portals to destinations that you
<ce>                think of. This kind of thing could be
<ce>                extremely dangerous. You pack it away
<ce>                   and try not to touch it at all.
