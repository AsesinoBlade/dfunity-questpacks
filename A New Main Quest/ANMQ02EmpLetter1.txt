Message:  1010
<ce>  A tall messenger, bearing the banner
<ce>  of the Imperial City, gives you a letter.

Message:  1011
To my friend %pcn
Last known region: ____here_
  
Message dictated to High Chancellor Ocato
  
My good friend, how are you doing?
Feel no hurry to respond to my message.
I am certain you have many important
things on your mind, and I do not wish to
take from your time.
  
It appears my simple mission for you has become
much more complex. I nevertheless believe I have
sent the right person. There will be no replacement
for you. I trust you wholeheartedly, and hope for
the same from you.
  
I'm aware you lost, sold, or somehow misplaced your
  imperial seal. In other cases I would call for censure,
  but I am certain you did things with the proper judgment.
  One day you will tell me the story, and I will understand.
  
  I agree with your decision to trust in Popudax.
  Were the noble Lysandus still alive he would be
  my counselor in all things, but his court
  wizard makes a fine replacement.
  
  Many will try to bribe you and sway your judgment.
  I have sent you to a land of soft words and flattery.
  Remember that the nicer the appearance, the less
  likely they speak with sincerity.
  
  Now that the word concerning Numidium is out, the
  whole land will move to recover it. I trust in you,
  both to survive in these wild times and to return
  its power to me. As Tiber Septim's descendant,
  carrying his legacy, I will protect the Empire
  he gave his life to create. All people will be
  safe under my command. You know this perfectly well.
  
  I look forward to hearing more of your adventures,
  my confidant.
  
  The Divines be on your side
  Uriel Septim VII
