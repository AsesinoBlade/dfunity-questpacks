<ce>           The guards of Castle Wayrest have committed your
<ce>              face to memory, and bark for you to leave
<ce>               the premises. They don't attack you yet,
<ce>           but watch carefully to make sure you don't speak
<ce>                     to any of the royal family.
                                     <--->
<ce>            The guards of Castle Wayrest recognize you and
<ce>          shout furiously for you to leave. They hold their
<ce>          weapons at the ready, making sure you don't speak
<ce>                         to the royal family.
                                     <--->
<ce>          Upon recognizing you, the guards of Castle Wayrest
<ce>             draw their weapons and get ready to attack.
<ce>           They haven't received an order to kill you yet,
<ce>       but will not hesitate if you approach the royal family.

<ce>           The guards tolerated you this far, but no more.
<ce>           The members of the royal family are escorted to
<ce>           a secure location while a small legion unleashes
<ce>                          its fury on you.
