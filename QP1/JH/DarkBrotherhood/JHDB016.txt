QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  Occasionally we receive requests to claim a life
<ce>  while deflecting suspicion. The greatest assassins
<ce>  in all Tamriel know how to make people die quickly
<ce>  or slowly, which is why our business recurs.
<ce>  Will you accept a simple job to poison a mark?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  Why? Do you need to drink blood after every kill?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  This task will send you to ___tavern_.
<ce>  The target, _mark_, is expecting a shipment of
<ce>  _plant_ within =2tavern_ days' time. You will
<ce>  deliver this in its place. We have dispatched %g3
<ce>  regular courier, so you will face no interference.
<ce>  Avoid unshielded contact with the plant. The poison
<ce>  we have placed on it will react over several hours.
<ce>  To avoid suspicion, you must not stay within the
<ce>  building for more than a few minutes. Your face
<ce>  will be easily remembered otherwise. Return
<ce>  when the task is finished. Farewell.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  _mark_ expected the _plant_
<ce>  to arrive in ___tavern_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  I presume you did not linger in the tavern
<ce>  for very long? It would be a shame for the Brotherhood
<ce>  to be associated with clumsy traipsing by one of its
<ce>  members, no matter %pg3 history. Your devotion
<ce>  has been noted, %pct.

Message:  1015
<ce>  The time you've spent in this tavern has given the
<ce>  patrons time to commit you to memory. Your work has failed.

Message:  1020
<ce>  Yes, courier? Why thank you! Yes, this will do just fine.
<ce>  A lovely sample if I say so myself. Finest work. Send my
<ce>  regards to my friends. It'll be some time before I can visit.
