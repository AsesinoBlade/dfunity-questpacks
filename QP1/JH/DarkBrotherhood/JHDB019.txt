<ce> Where the art of killing excels, the art of
<ce> defense must also rise in potency. We have
<ce> received an accounting that will involve
<ce> a studious mind as well as a lethal strike.
<ce> I have confidence that you will solve the
<ce> puzzle and slay the mark.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> I do misplace my confidence occasionally.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Your task will take you to _res_
<ce> of ___res_. To be short in words,
<ce> you must undo a spell cast by a magician
<ce> which keeps your mark from all kinds of
<ce> detection, a sort of stasis effect
<ce> touching both time and space. Our attempts
<ce> to extract the magician ended his life, and
<ce> now we only have his belongings left.
<ce> One of these three enchanted objects will
<ce> undo the stasis effect, and the other two
<ce> will unleash curses on you: a decanter,
<ce> a bell, and a wand. The mage left behind
<ce> a code of sorts for his apprentices in case
<ce> they would need to undo the spell. I will now
<ce> copy it into your journal. Study it and ensure
<ce> that you understand which of the three objects
<ce> is the key to the puzzle. With that explanation
<ce> given, you will have =timer_ days to slay
<ce> your target and return.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> You needed to resolve the puzzle
<ce> and the accounting by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> The Brotherhood prides itself in the quality of
<ce> its members. Your activities are proof that our work
<ce> cannot be hindered. The Night Mother prevails once more.

Message:  1011
<ce> Your mark relaxes a little upon seeing
<ce> the basilisk's eye.
<ce> 
<ce> "I have never seen you before, which
<ce> is a poor omen. Who are you and
<ce> why have you sought me out?"

Message:  1012
<ce> _th_ tears the paper from your
<ce> hands and starts to read, never fully
<ce> taking %g3 attention from you. After
<ce> reading it twice through, %g1
<ce> starts to think.
<ce> 
<ce> "Fine then. %pcf, I guess I have no reason
<ce> to doubt you. Where's the pay for this job?
<ce> This wasn't a simple murder."

Message:  1013
<ce> You offer the _gem_, which %g1 eyes greedily.
<ce> The instant it touches %g3 hand, %g3 eyes grow
<ce> wide. Magical power seems to waft away from %g2.
<ce> _th_ unsheathes %g3 weapon and shouts,
<ce> "What?! No! No, I'll kill you! Die, filthy pig!"

Message:  1014
<ce> Without %g3 leadership, _th_'s guild will dissolve.

Message:  1015
<ce> You show _th_ the basilisk's eye
<ce> and explain what the Dark Brotherhood has sent you
<ce> to do. At first %g1 is far too suspicious and
<ce> intends to escape, but you quickly show the letter
<ce> and payment that were meant to deceive %g2.
<ce> 
<ce> "Can this be so? _qgiver_ has actually
<ce> found us? This cannot be. And who are you to trick
<ce> the Dark Brotherhood? What do you want?"
<ce> 
<ce> You insinuate that a payment would probably be
<ce> appropriate for the service you've rendered.
<ce> Grumbling a little, %g1 nevertheless sees the
<ce> sense of paying you off. You accept =reward_ gold
<ce> pieces in a small pouch, and _th_
<ce> mutters a spell to disappear.

<ce> _th_'s suspicions win %g2 over.
<ce> "I knew it!" %g1 shouts before casting a
<ce> spell, conveying %g2 out of the building entirely.
<ce> You have lost your opportunity.

%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of the Dark Brotherhood,
 ___qgiver_, has tasked me with going to
 _res_ of ___res_ to
 slay someone with a stasis enchantment.
 I have been given a bell, a decanter, and
 a wand, only one of which will undo the spell
 and make the mark vulnerable.
