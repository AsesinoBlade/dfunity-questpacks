<ce>                I'm just gonna say it. I hate the Mages Guild.
<ce>                 It's nothing personal, they just do stupid
<ce>                    things. Like summoning a daedra and
<ce>                  losing control of it. Then they come crying
<ce>                   to us to fix their problem. All I've got to
<ce>                     offer you is this _reward_, which I'll
<ce>                       admit isn't a lot. You in, %pcf?
<--->
<ce>           So, funny story. The Mages Guild goes around
<ce>           all the time with their big, colorful robes and
<ce>           pompous attitudes all the time talking 'bout
<ce>           how great they are, right? Until one of them
<ce>           summons a daedra and they don't know how
<ce>           to get rid of it. Bunch of idiots. They gave me
<ce>           this _reward_, which'll be yours if you go
<ce>           down into ___dungeon_ and kill it.

<ce>                       Well, maybe this'll make those morons
<ce>                          learn some responsibility for once.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Fair warning, we already lost some people
<ce>                    to this abomination. It's crawling around
<ce>                    in ___dungeon_, probably
<ce>                     trying to summon more of its kind. Get
<ce>                     back here within =timer_ days, before I
<ce>                        start a fight with the Archmagister.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>         _questgiver_'s agreement to slay
<ce>          the daedra for the Mages Guild has expired.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                         Someone on the second floor bet you
<ce>                        weren't coming back. I made some money
<ce>                         off of you today. Here's your payment,
<ce>                          just in case it's worth killing a daedra.
