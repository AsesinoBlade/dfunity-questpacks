<ce>          We've got a job for someone experienced like you,
<ce>           %pcf, but I'm not gonna blame you for turning
<ce>           it down. It involves one vampire and no sunlight.
<ce>              You think you can fix that kind of problem?
<ce>                  There's =reward_ gold in it for you.
<--->
<ce>          Ever killed a vampire before, %pcf? Not one
<ce>          of them ancients. Those things give me the
<ce>          willies, and if they don't for you, you're not human.
<ce>          No, we've got a request here to floor some simple
<ce>          vampire in a house over in ___vampres_.
<ce>          Take this one if you feel ready for it.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                       I'll look for someone else then.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>          So here's the deal. You're headed to  _vampres_.
<ce>          That'll be in ___vampres_. Slay the beast
<ce>          and get back here so I can get you your =reward_ gold.
<ce>          I'm giving you =timer_ days before I send for backup 
<ce>          from a temple or something. Good luck, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>           You needed to slay the vampire in ___vampres_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>           Excellent work, %pcf. This is why
<ce>            we count on you. Have your gold.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Did you hear about the vampire that showed up in ___vampres_? I can't sleep anymore.

Message:  1020
<ce>                   "No!" The vampire shrieks
<ce>                 before crumpling to the floor.
