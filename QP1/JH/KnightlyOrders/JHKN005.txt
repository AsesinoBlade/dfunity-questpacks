<ce>  My %pct, we have a task which would ordinarily
<ce>   go only to our squires in training. Were there not
<ce>  some element of danger involved, I would not waste
<ce>  my breath nor your time. The law requires an
<ce>  object of evidence in a recent murder, which the
<ce>  town guard neglected to recover at the time of
<ce>  the arrest. Since this matter involves a serial killer
<ce>  and multiple cities, jurisdiction belongs to
<ce>   %crn, and the %t has asked
<ce>  for our assistance. Will you recover the evidence?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>      Then be off with you. Search for some more
<ce>        noble purpose than administering justice.

<ce>     Good. The _clothes_ will be in
<ce>       ___res_, inside a house called
<ce>      _res_, which is watched by the city
<ce>     guard. Should any of them question you
<ce>      upon entry, merely state your name and
<ce>      affiliation. Once you have it, return here
<ce>      quickly. The rogue acted in concert with some
<ce>       accomplices, such that we have suspicion
<ce>       of some manner of violent intervention.
<ce>      Be here within =timer_ days, and no later.
<ce>     The trial cannot be delayed further by halfwit
<ce>   assistance. %god be with you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>        Not a moment too late, %pcf, for the trial has
<ce>        been expedited. This _clothes_ and the testimony
<ce>        of the witnesses will surely bring justice to
<ce>        %crn tomorrow. Well done.
<--->
<ce>        Reliability on all matters, small and great, is
<ce>        worthy of a hero. I thank you for making the journey.
<--->
<ce> Excellent, %pct. We can now expedite
<ce> the trial. Superb work on all counts.

<ce>	You creep through the building silently.

Message:  1020
<ce>         The guards ignored your entry. Now
<ce>    you must find the _clothes_.
<--->
<ce>         Once inside, now you must find the _clothes_.

Message:  1021
<ce>     You think you hear footsteps.

Message:  1022
<ce> You've found the _clothes_. Now
<ce> to get back to ___questgiver_.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ has sent me to
 ___res_ to look for one
 _clothes_ inside _res_,
 which I need to return to
 ___questgiver_ within =timer_ days.

Message:  1099
<ce>        We need the _clothes_
<ce>        the town guard left in
<ce>        ___res_. Go quickly.
