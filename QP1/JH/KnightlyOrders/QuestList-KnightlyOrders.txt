-JHKN007: Path 1 the mage betrays you and uses some spell to bind the daedra to use its power for his own maybe he warps to a dungeon or to another area of the city while having npcs spawning to attack you (while he does his thing powering up or whatever) If you have a high Mysticism/Intelligence you can stop him and after that you just need to fight the mage and finish off the daedra
-JHKN007: If the Daedra is in a house once you enter have it teleport you to a random dungeon (the idea is the daedra is warping the world around it) Maybe with a high enough Illusion/Intelligence stats you get a pop up saying you have a bad feeling maybe you should go get more help with yes (you should go back the the knights order for help) or no go in and get teleported If you got help maybe you bring back a few more mages now you got a mission to "protect them" from random daedra npc while they cast some spells to get the High level Daedra out of the house so you can kill it. Now if you get Warped to the dungeon have it so you have to find and kill the daedra (while the game spawns more daedra type npcs on you in the dungeon) maybe at the start have it taunt you and the mage with the pop up messages (maybe have a chance for the mage to go mad with fear and either attack or run off adding an extra step of either finding the mage and killing him or using way to calm him down and saving him or you could just leave him behind) Hmm trying to think of the skills that could be used to "calm down" the mage before he goes crazy and runs off maybe Personality / Medical Also is it possible to make it so you can't leave the dungeon from the exit? or at least warp you back to the same dungeon if you use it? (the whole idea is the Daedra is warping reality)Anyway after you kill it you get teleported back to the city it was at since its no longer warping reality
