QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  My name is _qgiver_. The Order has
<ce>  recently been made aware of a terror of
<ce> the night, a vampire of no small renown,
<ce>  lurking in a pitiful hole in %crn.
<ce> We are the protectorate of this land and 
<ce>  cannot tolerate such a threat to its people.
<ce>  Will you answer the call and descend into
<ce>  the depths of ___dung_
<ce>  to slay this undead monster?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  We could certainly let it consume a few more 
<ce> innocents and grow more powerful, yes.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Then be going to ___dung_
<ce> to rid us of this evil. You will be
<ce> accompanied by _mage_
<ce> of the Mages Guild, whose main
<ce> purpose will be ensuring the body
<ce> is incapable of rising once more.
<ce> Nevertheless, %g1 could have something
<ce> meaningful to offer in combat.
<ce> The two of you will return here in =timer_
<ce> days with a report of your success. Farewell.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  Your deadline to slay the vampire and report to
<ce>  _qgiver_ has passed.
<ce>  _mage_ excuses %g2self and departs.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Hail our vampire slayers of vampires! Such a
<ce>  crusade should always merit the
<ce>  attention of knights. We will
<ce>  speak of your deeds to inspire
<ce>  the younger generation to rise
<ce>  above their own selves.

Message:  1010
<ce>  _mage_ recognizes this vampire at once.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Ho! =vam1_, your end has at hand!"
<ce>  
<ce>  A binding spell follows, which slows
<ce>  the abomination momentarily. This must
<ce>  be preparation for the corpse disposal.

Message:  1011
<ce>  _mage_ recognizes this vampire at once.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Ho! =vam2_, your end has at hand!"
<ce>  
<ce>  A binding spell follows, which slows
<ce>  the abomination momentarily. This must
<ce>  be preparation for the corpse disposal.

Message:  1020
<ce>  You have defeated the vampire.
<ce>  _mage_ spends some time with fairly
<ce>  elaborate pyrotechnics and sharp instruments,
<ce>  the likes of which do not logically lead
<ce>  to a permanent end to vampirism but against
<ce>  which you hold no qualm. Soon you are both
<ce>  ready to leave.
<--->
<ce>  You have defeated the vampire.
<ce>  _mage_ casts several arcane spells
<ce>  around the corpse which appear to hold
<ce>  it in place. Whether it will serve the
<ce>  purpose or not is beyond your knowledge
<ce>  and responsibility. Soon you are both
<ce>  ready to leave.
