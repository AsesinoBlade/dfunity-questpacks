<ce>  One of our newer members came to me earlier
<ce>  with a convoluted request involving gargoyle
<ce>  skins, debt, thaumaturgy, and a bookstore
<ce>  belonging to a friend. After a good ten minutes
<ce>  I still could not grasp the slightest idea
<ce>  behind the proposition, except that a partner
<ce>  was urgently needed, one with a degree of combat
<ce>  skill. Could you be a particularly helpful assistant
<ce>  in getting this request out of my waning hair?
<--->
<ce>  Please entertain my request, my good %pct.
<ce>  One of our newer members, someone who has spent
<ce>  fewer hours in the guild hall than I years,
<ce>  has battered me with repeated requests involving
<ce>  some extremely complicated scheme promising
<ce>  results of a paradisiacal kind. I doubt much of the
<ce>  plot's coherence or logic but I need to get back
<ce>  to my work, Would you be kind enough to pull
<ce>  this insistent child off my back for a time?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  Well, could you at least remind me which
<ce>  spells are used to cure a headache?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  My gratitude goes with you, my friend.
<ce>  I've barely been able to keep my thoughts
<ce>  afloat with that rattling noise about me.
<ce>  Well now, let me call out. Hold on a minute.
<ce>  
<ce>  Excuse me! I've found a companion for you!
<ce>  Come see here! This is %pcn.
<ce>  I'm sure you will work splendidly on that
<ce>  something-or-other you were so insistent about.

<ce>  As your colleague comes out of an adjoining
<ce>  room, _qgiver_ whispers,
<ce>  "Regardless of the outcome, I assure you
<ce>  I will credit you for a success. That
<ce>  is worth the service you now render me."
