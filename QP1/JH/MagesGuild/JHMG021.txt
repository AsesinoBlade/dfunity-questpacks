<ce>  One of our newer members came to me earlier with
<ce>  a convoluted request. After a good ten minutes
<ce>  I still could not grasp the slightest idea
<ce>  behind the proposition, except that a partner
<ce>  was urgently needed, one quite similar to your
<ce>  capabilities. Could you be particularly helpful
<ce>  in getting this request out of my waning hair?
<--->
<ce>  Please entertain my request, my good %pct.
<ce>  One of our newer members, someone who has spent
<ce>  fewer hours in the guild hall than I years,
<ce>  has battered me with repeated requests involving
<ce>  some extremely complicated scheme promising
<ce>  results of a miraculous kind. All I remember
<ce>  is that the qualifications very much resemble
<ce>  yours. Would you be kind enough to pull this
<ce>  insistent child off my back for a time?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  Well, could you at least remind me which
<ce>  spells are used to cure a headache?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  My gratitude goes with you, my friend.
<ce>  I've barely been able to keep my thoughts
<ce>  afloat with that rattling noise about me.
<ce>  Well now, let me call out. Hold on a minute.
<ce>  
<ce>  Excuse me! I've found a companion for you!
<ce>  Come see here! This is %pcn.
<ce>  I'm sure you will work splendidly on that
<ce>  something-or-other you were so insistent about.

<ce>  As you wait, _qgiver_ whispers,
<ce>  
<ce>  "Regardless of the outcome, I will
<ce>  credit you for a success. That is
<ce>  worth the service you now render me."

Message:  1010
<ce>  Ah, %pcf, how are you getting along?
<ce>  My sincerest apologies, but I'm rather
<ce>  wrapped up in administrative duties at
<ce>  this time. All the tasks I hand out and
<ce>  receive carry serious responsibilities,
<ce>  you see. Could you give me a few hours?
<ce>  I will be happy to attend to you when
<ce>  I've finished, dear friend.
