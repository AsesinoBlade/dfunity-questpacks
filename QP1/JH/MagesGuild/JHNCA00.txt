<ce>  "Certainly that is your choice. I will soon leave
<ce>  and you will not meet me again. But remember that
<ce>  just as the Necromancers are merciful against
<ce>  transgressors, we exercise our wrath upon those
<ce>  who stubbornly persecute us. Remember it,
<ce>  %pcf. Safe travels to you."

<ce>  Casting a spell, your benefactor fades from sight.

<ce>  The spellcaster calls a few incantations in a
<ce>  line of speech you do not recognize. It apparently
<ce>  takes great effort, though you feel nothing.
<ce>  How much of this is theatrics or true power
<ce>  is not in your grasp to discern. After several
<ce>  moments your contact seems satisfied.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I see no reason to doubt you. I believe your mind
<ce>  is free of guile. I will now extend to you the first of
<ce>  your tasks in the service of the King of Worms."

<ce>  letter. He has made great efforts to blend into the populace.

    One of our kind has spoken to us concerning your conversation.
Your actions come as a pleasant surprise, and we intend to show
that fairness and justice which well characterizes us.
<ce>
    Writing on behalf of the Necromancers, I invite you to meet
in person. I must judge your character. Should you be proven
worthy, we will send you forth to aid us in various sundry tasks.
This may seem an odd invitation if your memory is short, but
we well remember that your acts generally have not been charitable
toward us. If you will gather the good will of the Necromancers,
it will be by blood and sweat, not tender fireside discussion.
<ce>
    Consider the greatness of the opportunity I extend to you.
Meet me in ___nhome_, at _nhome_. I will
render judgment and decide if you are worthy to earn our trust.
Do not tarry more than =2nhome_ days.

<ce>  This person reeks of death, as though returning from several
<ce>  weeks in an open cemetery, or perhaps under the earth.
<ce>  
<ce>  "%pcn, I welcome you to my humble abode.
<ce>  Forgive me for failing to provide the ordinary pleasantries,
<ce>  but I had no time to prepare tea and stew. My kind are
<ce>  continually hunted by your kind. Living in the margins of
<ce>  society can be quite unpleasant, but it is the price to pay
<ce>  for the incredible power afforded to the disciples
<ce>  of the King of Worms.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Permit me momentary bluntness. Your acts against the
<ce>  Necromancers have been cruel, severe, and undeserved.
<ce>  We do not know what we have done to earn your wrath.
<ce>  But let it not be said that the dark artists bear
<ce>  hard hearts. We wish for reconciliation with you, that
<ce>  you may show your worth to the King of Worms and earn
<ce>  his favor. Will you allow me to probe your mind
<ce>  and satisfy my doubts concerning you before
<ce>  giving you your first task?"
