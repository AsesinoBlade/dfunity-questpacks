<ce>  _person_ slumps onto the ground,
<ce>  having suffered too much from the strains of travel.
<ce>  The vampires should be satisfied with %g3 death
<ce>  once they find the corpse.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  You take the _tri_ and break it in half with a
<ce>  satisfying crunch, and then crush it under foot.
<ce>  The vampires will no longer have any reason to pursue you.

Message:  1010
<ce>  "Oh, good! Thank you for coming to help.
<ce>  You are a master at combat, yes? I know
<ce>  that will be a great help, for we're
<ce>  going to rescue the famed researcher
<ce>  _dummy_. You lead the way to
<ce>  ___dung_ and I'll help with the rest.
<ce>  I'll just mark it on your map."
<ce>  
<ce>  _person_ shakes your hand eagerly.

Message:  1011
<ce>  I've gotta come clean with you, %pcf.
<ce>  Everything I told them in there, that's all
<ce>  a lie. I just joined this place 'cause I need
<ce>  help, really bad. I've got vampires coming after
<ce>  me. They wanna kill me. I left some holy relic as
<ce>  a prank down in ___dung_. Went down
<ce>  with some friends and we all had a good laugh,
<ce>  said we'd really stirred up some trouble now.
<ce>  I'm the only one left alive. Please, you gotta
<ce>  help me. I can't go down there myself with them
<ce>  bloodsuckers coming on me. I'll die. They've
<ce>  got my scent, and now it's on you too. We're
<ce>  gonna go smash that relic together, right?

Message:  1012
<ce>  %oth. Really, you know, you have no idea
<ce>  what this means to me. Some day I'll pay you back,
<ce>  I promise. Lead the way to ___dung_.

Message:  1013
<ce>  This vampire hisses at you hatefully.
<ce>  No doubt there will be many more to follow.

Message:  1014
<ce>  _person_ jumps for joy.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Finally! Oh, %god, how I've waited for this!
<ce>  Here, let me sift some of that dust through
<ce>  my fingers. I can't believe I survived!
<ce>  You really are a hero! Wow, what a story!
<ce>  I'll tell it to all my posterity!"
<ce>  
<ce>  After moving %g3 fingers through the _tri_'s
<ce>  remains, %g1 absent-mindedly wanders off toward the
<ce>  dungeon entrance. Perhaps a simple expression of
<ce>  gratitude is too much to ask.

Message:  1020
<ce>  "What? No, it doesn't matter! They know my
<ce>  scent! It's on you! You're gonna have to destroy
<ce>  the thing anyway!"
<ce>  
<ce>  You push _person_ hard, putting as much
<ce>  distance between %g2 and you as possible.

Message:  1021
<ce>  A hooded figure approaches you.
<ce>  
<ce>  "The transgressor has been slain.
<ce>  Our vendetta is satisfied.
<ce>  Go in peace."
<ce>  
<ce>  You catch a glimpse of red eyes glancing
<ce>  at you. Your messenger then dashes away
<ce>  with superhuman speed.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _person_, a fellow member
 of the Mages Guild, has asked for my
 help in ___dung_.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 _person_ told me the truth:
 he and several friends went into
 ___dung_ and planted a holy
 relic as a joke to disturb a clan of vampires,
 who have taken their vengeance on everyone else.
 They are tracking his scent and it is now on me.
 The only way to appease their wrath is to
 destroy the relic in the depths.
