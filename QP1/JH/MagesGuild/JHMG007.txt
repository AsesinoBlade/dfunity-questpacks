<ce>           %pcf, do you like hearing from the %t? I do not.
<ce>          Most guild members also do not. Our research must
<ce>          not be interrupted by petty squabbles such as some
<ce>             mere murderer holed up in some ruins, as is
<ce>         the case at this moment. We received a request this
<ce>      morning to slay one such criminal that the Fighters Guild
<ce>        simply could not locate. Knowing of your combat skill,
<ce>           we wish to bestow this task upon you for the sum
<ce>         of =reward_ gold pieces. Are you ready to teleport?
                                     <--->
<ce>              Surely, it must be said that the %t takes
<ce>      advantage of us at times. It's not as though there aren't
<ce>         plenty of dashing, youthful adventurers across %crn
<ce>           willing to slay a criminal in a hole for money.
<ce>            Nevertheless, their incompetence lays the task
<ce>          instead at our feet. We have been given the order
<ce>               of disposing of an outlaw in some ruins,
<ce>          who must be surprised by the use of teleportation.
<ce>            Apparently all other means have failed to find
<ce>          the knave. If you are willing and ready, we should
<ce>       like to teleport you this instant to get this over with.

<ce>                     %oth. No one is, apparently.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>           Then we will send you off immediately. Our good
<ce>                   _dummy_ will do the incantation.
<ce>            I don't so much care about when you come back,
<ce>              so long as you come back alive. Let the %t
<ce>           take responsibility for these things sooner than
<ce>         bother us again. Once you're off I can say our work
<ce>       is in progress. Well then, I won't hold you any further.
<ce>                          Go ahead, _dummy_.

<ce>           Oh, %pcf, I am overjoyed at your return. The %t
<ce>         sent a few missives while we waited, and I rejoiced
<ce>   to reply with certain choice words not fit for this guild hall.
<ce>       I feel to reject such petitions in the future, had I the
<ce>       confidence this building would not be closed upon within
<ce>     the week. You have certainly earned your reward. Thank you.

Message:  1010
<ce>      Your work is to find an assassin somewhere in this place.
<ce>
<ce>  (Hint: You may be in a location that's impossible to escape from,)
<ce>                 (like the bottom of a chute. If so,)
<ce>   (make a save and try the console command "teleport" to get out.)
