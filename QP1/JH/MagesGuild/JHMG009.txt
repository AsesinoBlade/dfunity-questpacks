<ce> If you will hear it, we have a bit
<ce> of a difficulty, so to speak. The famed
<ce> researcher _dummy_ has left
<ce> us a manuscript of very valuable research,
<ce> which needs to get to ___res_
<ce> after =2res_ days' time. Our colleague
<ce> _client_ won't arrive until
<ce> then, so the documents must be kept safe.
<ce> We have good reason to believe the
<ce> Thieves Guild will pursue their carrier.
<ce> Will you escort these papers, knowing of
<ce> the danger surrounding them?
<--->
<ce> We have need of a delivery, but only after
<ce> certain days have passed. We have here
<ce> papers from the great _dummy_
<ce> that need to get to ___res_
<ce> after =2res_ days have passed. Meanwhile,
<ce> it's quite likely the Thieves Guild will
<ce> attempt to waylay whoever carries them.
<ce> Can you provide them a safe delivery?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> I certainly hope our guild hall can
<ce> withstand the Thieves Guild's intrusions.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> How wonderful! _client_ will
<ce> have a sum of money for you once you arrive.
<ce> I don't know what you'll do to keep the
<ce> papers safe, but you'll use your best thinking
<ce> to accomplish it. Be cautious around the
<ce> Thieves Guild. They are not accustomed to
<ce> fighting so much as stealing, and I worry
<ce> that offending them will not be easily
<ce> forgotten. But whatever you do, do not
<ce> give up that manuscript. May %god
<ce> watch over you these next =2res_ days.

<ce> Good day. What have we here? Ah, a
<ce> sample of _dummy_'s fine work.
<ce> Let me check whether it has %g3 seal.
<ce> Well, it appears to be in proper order
<ce> and condition. Send my regards to
<ce> _qgiver_. Here is your
<ce> payment. A pleasure speaking to you.

<ce> Don't toy with us here. We're Thieves Guild.
<ce> Just give us the papers and get lost.
