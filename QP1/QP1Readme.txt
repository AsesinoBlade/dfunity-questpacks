Daggerfall Quest Pack 1 (Jay_H)

TO INSTALL:

Extract the folder QP1 into the \DaggerfallUnity_Data\StreamingAssets\QuestPacks folder of your Daggerfall Unity installation.

TO UNINSTALL:

Delete the folder QP1 from the \DaggerfallUnity_Data\StreamingAssets\QuestPacks folder of your Daggerfall Unity installation.


Take note of the following points:

* Skill checks have been implemented into some quests. An example format is "SKILL CHECK: YES: Streetwise, very high". This means that if you click the YES button at the prompt, a check will be made against your Streetwise skill, which should be very high if you want to pass. If it passes, you get a particular benefit. If it fails, something bad will happen. Choose wisely!


* Quests that teleport you into a dungeon can land you in an inescapable situation, such as inside a closed pit. Use the console command "teleport" when necessary to come free.
