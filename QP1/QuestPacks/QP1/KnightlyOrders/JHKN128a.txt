<ce>                 You gave your word of honor that you
<ce>                       would rid ___store_
<ce>                       of its the necromancer.
<ce>                       You have taken too long.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             The necromancer is now dead. ___store_ will
<ce>           be overjoyed at its newfound freedom from evil.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
You wanna help with the necromancer? Look for _help_.
<--->
I saw the necromancer once at night! I was terrified!
<--->
Gonna kill that necromancer? Good job!
<--->
Sorry high-and-mighty knight, but if we can't find him, how could you?
<--->
Don't tell no one, but I've heard weird things in _random_.
<--->
Looking for that necromancer? How's about you try in _random2_?
<--->
Have you been in _random3_? Necromancer's gotta be in there.

RumorsPostSuccess:  [1007]
Wait, you're %pcn? The one who saved ___store_?
<--->
Apparently taxes in ____store_ work.

<ce>            You hail a nearby guard and are informed that
<ce>                    a local resident named _help_
<ce>           claims to know of the necromancer's whereabouts
<ce>          but is too afraid to tell. Otherwise you are free
<ce>              to roam the city and look for the culprit.

<ce>            Someone with a more fluid tongue perhaps could
<ce>             have persuaded %g2, but that someone is not
<ce>               you. You'll have to look for the villain
<ce>               without this particular source of help.

Message:  1013
<ce>             "N-no, to be honest, you can't keep me safe.
<ce>             I know it. I saw the necromancer myself and
<ce>              know where the hideout is. But to keep my
<ce>             mouth shut, I got a curse. I can't say where
<ce>           it is or else I'm gonna die, right on the spot.
<ce>                 I can feel it on me, I'm bewitched!
<ce>                        So I can't tell you!"
<ce>
<ce>           Do you try to pry further or let the matter be?

Message:  1014
<ce>            "No! I'm serious! I'll drop dead if I say it!
<ce>              I can't do this, so just leave me alone!"
<ce>
<ce>             Were you more practiced in magic, you could
<ce>               perhaps undo the curse yourself. Sadly,
<ce>             that is not your lot. Nevertheless, a matter
<ce>             of this urgency could justify some corporal
<ce>               mistreatment if it gets the information
<ce>                   out of %g2. Do you force _help_
<ce>           to tell you where the necromancer's hideout is?

<ce>          Sometimes the ends justify the means, you reason,
