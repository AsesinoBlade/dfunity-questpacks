<ce>  Yes? Oh, bother. Another for that condemned league of whatever.
<ce>  The King put me in charge of this, and it's been an unceasing headache
<ce>  for the past two weeks. If you want to join this group of crusaders
<ce>  or whatever it is, go find _pers_ at _fg_ here in town.
<ce>  That's who you need to talk to. I'm no more than a figurehead.
<ce>  
<ce>  Now go on, get out of here.

 Lord Bridwell told me that the actual recruiter for the
 League of Legendary Dogooders is found in _fg_
 here in the city of ___fg_, named _pers_.

Message:  1013
<ce>  _pers_ is quite excited already, and lights up
<ce>  even more upon your introduction.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Hello! Hurrah! Yes, I am _pers_ of the
<ce>  Legendary League of Dogooders! Are you here to join?"

Message:  1014
<ce>  "Wonderful! Now, we have a minimal requirement of being able
<ce>  to do combat in our order. We must be able to stop evil
<ce>  by any manner necessary; we prefer to do it with words,
<ce>  but when words fail, we must defend ourselves and others!
<ce>  Are you capable of combat?"

Message:  1015
<ce>  "Oh, that is good. I'm very happy to hear it!
<ce>  But we must be certain. We wouldn't want you to overestimate
<ce>  your ability, after all! Let me call over a squire to spar with you."
<ce>  
<ce>  _pers_ excuses %g2self and calls for a nearby warrior.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Now, have at it! Let me see your skill. I highly doubt you'll
<ce>  be able to kill each other, so don't hold back!
<ce>  (Though really, avoid the instant death magicks, would you?)"

Message:  1016
<ce>  _pers_ cries in terror upon seeing the squire die.
<ce>  
<ce>  "No no no no no! You are unfit for our order!
<ce>  Begone from here! Guards! Someone help!"

Message:  1017
<ce>  "That's good enough," _pers_ calls out.
<ce>  The squire bows and then leaves the building.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Well, you seem fit to do combat. I think you'll be okay.
<ce>  Come over here and I'll ask you some questions,
<ce>  and we'll see whether you will work out in our league."

Message:  1018
<ce>  "Okay. First question: Will you swear to do good,
<ce>   defend the defenseless, and administer justice?"

Message:  1019
<ce>  "Will you swear to use violence only as necessary
<ce>  to defend yourself and others while laboring in our tasks?"

Message:  1020
<ce>  "Will you refrain from blaspheming the eight divine Gods,
<ce>  as well as the gods of the orcs and of every other
<ce>  conscious being?"

Message:  1021
<ce>  "Will you ensure all your acts are in harmony with
<ce>  civilized law, your conscience, and the name of
<ce>  the League of Legendary Dogooders?"

Message:  1022
<ce>  "Do you happen to like cats?"

Message:  1023
<ce>  "Sorry, I just like to throw that last one in for fun.
<ce>  I find you a fit candidate! And I'm actually going
<ce>  to submit your name for early leadership.
<ce>  You seem to be more experienced than the ordinary
<ce>  recruit. You'll still begin as a footsoldier,
<ce>  but I'll make sure Master Greenham at least
<ce>  sees your name in the next few days.
<ce>  Distinguish yourself, and do us proud!
<ce>  
<ce>  "We'll call on your services as needed. I don't know
<ce>  when the next occasion will be, but stay within
<ce>  the province of ____fg_, would you?
<ce>  I hear word that there's going to be a raid
<ce>  on some criminal lair soon, and you won't want to miss it."

Message:  1024
<ce>  "Ehm, to be honest, I wasn't expecting a 'no.'
<ce>  A good candidate will uphold all our norms, and swear to it.
<ce>  But it's better to be honest now than to cause us grief
<ce>  on the battlefield. Good day to you!"
<ce>  
<ce>  _pers_ bows and then excuses %g2self.

Message:  1025
<ce>  "Oh. Well, I do enjoy a good chat, but I'm being paid for this.
<ce>  I must make sure I attend to my business. Farewell!"

Message:  1026
<ce>  You flee the duel, and lose your opportunity to prove
<ce>  yourself to the League of Legendary Dogooders.
<ce>  Oh well.

Message:  1027
%qdt:
 I have been officially inducted into the League of
 Legendary Dogooders as a footsoldier. _pers_
 recommended that I stay around the region of
 ____fg_ in preparation for a raid
 on a criminal lair in the next few days.
