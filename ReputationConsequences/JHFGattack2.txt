<ce>  Armed opponents make a formation around you,
<ce>  and they aren't subtle. The Fighters Guild
<ce>  may not be the smartest or the quietest
<ce>  source of adventurers, but they are good at killing.
<ce>  Today, you're the target.
<--->
<ce>  "%pcf! Stop right there!"
<ce>  
<ce>  You're brought up straight by the approach
<ce>  of a few armed figures. They ready their weapons.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Should've left the Fighters Guild alone.
<ce>  Now you'll pay!"
