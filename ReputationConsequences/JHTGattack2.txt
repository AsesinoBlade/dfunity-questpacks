Message:  1010
<ce>  A tiny wrapped object has shown up among
<ce>  your belongings, and it explodes at the
<ce>  slightest provocation. You're unable
<ce>  to escape a noxious cloud of erupting powder.
<ce>  The only trace remaining is a small ribbon with
<ce>  a heart drawn, and a Thieves Guild
<ce>  insignia inside it.
<--->
<ce>  Suddenly, a cloud of toxic powder bursts out
<ce>  from your belongings. Though you try to evade it,
<ce>  you're obliged to breathe in trace amounts
<ce>  of the substance, smelling akin to a mix of mold
<ce>  and rotten eggs. A scrap of paper flies to the ground
<ce>  with the words, "Your friends at the Thieves Guild."
