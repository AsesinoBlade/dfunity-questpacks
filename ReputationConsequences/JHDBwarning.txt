Message:  1010
<ce>  A courier stands in your path, as if knowing
<ce>  you would come this way soon. She extends
<ce>  a letter to you with practiced ease.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Hello %pcf! Got a letter for you.
<ce>  Make sure you read it, and stay safe!"
<ce>  
<ce>  She departs, and you notice a black lining
<ce>  under her hood as she pulls it up.
<ce>  
<ce>  The paper looks disposable.
<ce>  You'll get rid of it in a day or two.

<ce>  
   Forgive this grievous imposition on your time.
   This task is unfortunate but occasionally necessary.
   A person with such stunning accomplishments as yours,
   whatever they might be, could perhaps have a
   great future in %crn, unless you continue to annoy
   the Dark Brotherhood as you have done thus far.
<ce>  
    We remember everything. Tempt fate and be buried.
