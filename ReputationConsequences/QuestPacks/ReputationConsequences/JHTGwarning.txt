Message:  1010
<ce>  By chance, you look among your belongings
<ce>  and find a new paper stuffed therein.
<ce>  You have no idea how it got there,
<ce>  nor when any messenger approached.
<ce>  
<ce>  The paper looks disposable.
<ce>  You'll get rid of it in a day or two.

   There are some people who live long lives
   full of happiness. Most of those people
   don't cross the Thieves Guild. Message
   is simple: quit messing with us.
   We're not fighters but we can make your
   life a new plane of Oblivion if we choose
   to. Think, then act.
<ce>  
      Don't doubt us.
