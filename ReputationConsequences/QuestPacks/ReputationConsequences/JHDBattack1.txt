Message:  1010
<ce>  You get the strange feeling that you're being watched.
<ce>  A quick look around you confirms your suspicion:
<ce>  one of the Dark Brotherhood's headhunters
<ce>  has found you. Multiple weapons come out for your blood.
<--->
<ce>  Something is wrong. You feel a presence nearby,
<ce>  both cold and unfeeling. Then a self-assured voice speaks
<ce>  from outside your view.
<ce>  
<ce>  "The Dark Brotherhood's gonna pay good money for this."
