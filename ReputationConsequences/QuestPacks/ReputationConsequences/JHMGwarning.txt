<ce>  You're aware of a harrier flying near you,
<ce>  driven by an unspoken purpose. Upon descent,
<ce>  it careens past you, planting
<ce>  a sealed letter among your belongings.
<ce>  It then soars away without a sound.
<ce>  
<ce>  The paper looks disposable.
<ce>  You'll get rid of it in a day or two.

<ce>  
   We have grown aware of certain grievous actions
   against the Mages Guild taken by someone matching
   your name and description. We must demand
   that this errant behavior cease immediately.
   Repair to a guild hall and curry our favor through
   some of our lesser tasks, lest you gain intimate knowledge
   of what is deemed "arcane wrath" by the conscientious.
<ce>  
      Attentively,
      _person_, Council Scribe
      Dictated by the Archmagister
