<ce> Where the art of killing excels, the art of
<ce> defense must also rise in potency. We have
<ce> received an accounting that will involve
<ce> a studious mind as well as a lethal strike.
<ce> I have confidence that you will solve the
<ce> puzzle and slay the mark.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> I do misplace my confidence occasionally.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Your task will take you to _res_
<ce> of ___res_. To be short in words,
<ce> you must undo a spell cast by a magician
<ce> which keeps your mark from all kinds of
<ce> detection, a sort of stasis effect
<ce> touching both time and space. Our attempts
<ce> to extract the magician ended his life, and
<ce> now we only have his belongings left.
<ce> One of these three enchanted objects will
<ce> undo the stasis effect, and the other two
<ce> will unleash curses on you: a pearl, a bell,
<ce> and a cloth amulet. The mage left behind
<ce> a glyph for his apprentices to transmit what
<ce> they would need to undo the spell. I will now
<ce> copy it into your journal. Study it and ensure
<ce> that you understand which of the three objects
<ce> is the key to the puzzle. With that explanation
<ce> given, you will have =timer_ days to slay
<ce> your target and return.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> You needed to resolve the puzzle
<ce> and the accounting by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> The Brotherhood prides itself in the quality of
<ce> its members. Your activities are proof that our work
<ce> cannot be hindered. The Night Mother prevails once more.

<ce> The solution must be in your journal.

<ce> You hold up the cloth amulet. A magical field
<ce> within the house reacts to its enchantment
<ce> and a massive hole opens up under your feet.
<ce> Before you can react, it sucks you into
<ce> an entirely different environment.

<ce> You hold up the bell. A magical field
<ce> within the house reacts to its enchantment
<ce> and begins to dissipate. Seemingly out
<ce> of thin air a person drops to the floor.
<ce> This must be the mark you're looking for.

<ce> "No! How?!"
<ce> 
<ce> This mark is no more.

 _res_ of ___res_ to
 slay someone with a stasis enchantment.
 I have been given a bell, a pearl, and a
 cloth amulet, only one of which will undo the spell
 and make the mark vulnerable. The mage left behind a
