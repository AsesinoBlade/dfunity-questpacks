Daggerfall Quest Pack 1 (Jay_H)

TO INSTALL:

Extract the folder QP1 into the \DaggerfallUnity_Data\StreamingAssets\QuestPacks folder of your Daggerfall Unity installation.

TO UNINSTALL:

Delete the folder QP1 from the \DaggerfallUnity_Data\StreamingAssets\QuestPacks folder of your Daggerfall Unity installation.


Take note of the following points:

* Minimal testing for game balance has been made. Bring feedback to the Daggerfall Workshop forums if some quest is ridiculously difficult when it should not be. JHMG00X, "Death's Embrace," is meant to be ridiculously difficult.

* Use Shift-Tab to make the quest information on your screen expand or disappear. This will also toggle the HUD compass.

* If the HUD compass points you towards some location that you have no obvious use for, ignore it. Every quest will tell you about any location that actually matters.

* Quests that teleport you into a dungeon can land you in an inescapable situation, such as inside a closed pit. Use the console command "teleport" when necessary to come free.
