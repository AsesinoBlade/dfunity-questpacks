<ce>        You may have been falsely accused, but
<ce>        such a simple matter would have been quickly forgotten.
<ce>        Killing your accuser would have made things worse.

<ce>        
<ce>        Your accuser acted rashly, but this got well
<ce>        out of hand. This bodes poorly for you once
<ce>        word of it gets around.
