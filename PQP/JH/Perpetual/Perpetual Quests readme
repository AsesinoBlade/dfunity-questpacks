The Perpetual Quest system is intended to make the Daggerfall Unity world come alive, spontaneously beginning a variety of quests that reach out to the player.

INSTALLATION
==========

1. Extract the contents of the PQP folder into \DaggerfallUnity_Data\StreamingAssets\Quests. Do not copy the actual folder PQP, only the text files.

2. Move the JHPFIRST file from the \StreamingAssets\QuestPacks\JH\Perpetual folder to the \StreamingAssets\Quests folder.

When creating a new character, a prompt will ask whether you wish to begin the Perpetual Quest system. After the system starts, the first quest will arrive in about one month's time.

Occasionally you may get a filler message, such as "You check your bearings momentarily" or "You feel a sudden rush of wind." This means the Perpetual Quest system chose a blank, and will try again in another month's time.

The console command "purgeallquests" will wipe the Perpetual Quest system from the quest list. It will have to be restarted using the console command "startquest JHPFIRST".

TO UNINSTALL
==========

Delete all files from JHCG001.txt to the last JHPQ###.txt.
