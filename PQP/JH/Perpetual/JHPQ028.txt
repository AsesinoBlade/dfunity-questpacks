<ce> The farmers shout with joy at your handiwork.
<ce> The threat eliminated, people start to gather
<ce> their coins, which one of the workers brings
<ce> to you as a show of gratitude.

Message:  1010
<ce> Curiously, you see a spriggan rooting up
<ce> some of the crops. People look around with fear,
<ce> and some prepare torches and gardening tools
<ce> in an attempt to defend the property. The creature
<ce> ignores their stance, offended at the cruel
<ce> captivity of the surrounding plants.
<ce> Do you help the people fight it off?

Message:  1011
<ce> The people look relieved at the sight of a real warrior.
<ce> They stand down and let you handle it.

Message:  1012
<ce> You watch from a distance as the people fight the creature
<ce> with minimal skill. Thankfully no one is killed, though
<ce> some suffer deep cuts from its noxious branches.
<ce> Once it falls they burn it and spread its ashes, and
<ce> then return to their business.
