<ce>        %oth, you can be lethal.
<ce>        
<ce>        Please don't misunderstand. I can be a bit
<ce>        overly dramatic at times, I understand. My
<ce>        siblings tell me as much when they come
<ce>        around. Well, I suppose some explanation is due.
<ce>        
<ce>        We belong to a clan who identify with a gift
<ce>        for illusion magic. It's not so much a clan in that
<ce>        we all trace to a common ancestor. We all
<ce>        adopt ourselves, you could say. In any case, we
<ce>        have an interest in expanding our sphere of
<ce>        influence. We are indeed shapeshifters, but
<ce>        we often find ourselves disadvantaged in other
<ce>        fields. Combat in general is something of a weak
<ce>        spot for us. We would enjoy counting you among
<ce>        our allies. If that sounds agreeable, we'll be sending
<ce>        you occasional missives according to our needs.
<ce>        We assure you we will compensate you for
<ce>        the work we do together. Oh, the things we could
<ce>        accomplish with your skill! But for now, farewell.
<ce>        Thank you for listening to me with such respect.
<ce>        
<ce>                      TO BE CONTINUED

<ce>        You discover a parchment among your
<ce>        belongings. Someone must have put
<ce>        it inside without your noticing.

Message:  1011
<ce>     Thank you for coming. Please, tell me your full name.
<ce>     
<ce>     Very well then, %pcn. I wish to test
<ce>     my skills and see if I emerge the victor. I ask that
<ce>     you hold nothing back. I have a small reward available
<ce>     for you if you succeed. Before we begin, however,
<ce>     I insist that you use weaponry capable of damaging
<ce>     the toughest foe, for my defenses are formidable.
<ce>      And if you leave this building, you forfeit our duel.
<ce>     
<ce>     Are you ready to begin?

Message:  1012
<ce>        I will wait then. But do not take long.

Message:  1013
<ce>        "Then let our duel begin!"
<ce>     
<ce>     _qg_ shouts a cantrip
<ce>     dramatically before disappearing. You
<ce>     brace yourself for the battle before you.

Message:  1014
<ce>       The rat keels over. _qg_'s
<ce>       voice breaks your puzzled thought process.
<ce>       
<ce>       "Well, you can kill a rat! So what? Take this!"

Message:  1015
<ce>       The bat drops to the ground pathetically.
<ce>       From its mouth you hear _qg_ say,
<ce>       
<ce>       "Warm-ups are over! Now we get serious!"

Message:  1016
<ce>       "No arachnophobe out of you! Get ready!"

Message:  1017
<ce>       From the giant fish's mouth you hear,
<ce>       
<ce>       "Come on, I want a real fight! Show
<ce>       me what the rumors talk about!"

Message:  1018
<ce>       The scorpion's body heaves and finally drops.
<ce>       
<ce>       "Well, so be it! Let's see you handle this!"

Message:  1019
<ce>       "Not the first wereboar you've seen, eh?
<ce>       But I'm just getting started!"

Message:  1020
<ce>       "Hmph! Then watch this!"

Message:  1021
<ce>       "No more ghosts! See if you can beat this!"

Message:  1022
<ce>       "A strength that can even break iron!
<ce>       But what about this?!"

Message:  1023
<ce>       The levitating dreugh drops to the ground.
<ce>       
<ce>       "Pretty impressive, right? But playtime is now over!"

Message:  1024
<ce>       "Breathing fire, even! But no more.
<ce>       Here's something else!"

Message:  1025
<ce>       "Stone skin cracked. All my tricks are shot!
<ce>       You leave me with no choice. See my true form!"

Message:  1026
<ce>       The vampire tumbles to the ground. As with
<ce>       the other creatures, a voice comes from its mouth.
<ce>       
<ce>       "It's been a long time since someone made
<ce>       it to Vampire. Your skill truly is memorable.
<ce>       Come, see me once more."
<ce>       
<ce>       _qg_ appears once again.
<ce>       Now you can get to the bottom of the matter.

Message: 1050
<ce>       _qg_'s voice booms in your ears.
<ce>       
<ce>       "HA! I've proven my victory! Leave
<ce>       %crn before my siblings and I
<ce>       leave your carcass nailed to a wall!"
