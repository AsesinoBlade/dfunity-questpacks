Message:  1010

<ce> Swamp Rot in %crn. You wonder whether you have come
<ce> into contact with some of the infected.

Message:  1011
<ce> Out of an abundance of caution you gather
<ce> some nearby ingredients using your Medical
<ce> skill and mix them into a bitter liquid which
<ce> you then drink. If you were at risk for getting
<ce> infected, this should be sufficient to ward it off.
