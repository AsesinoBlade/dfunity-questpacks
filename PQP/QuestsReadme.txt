Daggerfall Quest Pack 1 (Jay_H)

TO INSTALL:

TO UNINSTALL:

Take note of the following points:

* Minimal testing for game balance has been made. Bring feedback to the Daggerfall Workshop forums if some quest is ridiculously difficult when it should not be. JHMG00X, "Death's Embrace," is meant to be ridiculously difficult.

* Use Shift-Tab to make the quest information on your screen expand or disappear. This will also toggle the HUD compass.

* If the HUD compass points you towards some location that you have no obvious use for, ignore it. Every quest will tell you about any location that actually matters. One example is the Thieves Guild quest to run away with a stolen object.

* Quests that teleport you into a dungeon can land you in an inescapable situation, such as inside a closed pit. Use the console command "teleport" when necessary to come free.

* Sometimes, a friendly NPC is meant to disappear but does not. This occurs most frequently when an enemy is spawned at the same time. Just pretend how it's supposed to happen.

* Quest branches such as the Cartographers will get buggy if you accept more than one quest from them at a time. Either let your current quest with the Cartographers drop completely and start over, or continue in the quest line they have given you.

* Some Cartographer quests require you to actually step inside a dungeon for the location to register. Do not leave the location until you get a verification message of some sort.

* When you hear the "telltale snarl of a werewolf," killing it will begin a quest with lots of werewolves. If you want to avoid that, flee it and the next werewolf that spawns. That will prevent the quest from initializing.

* In general, do not undertake a Perpetual Quest while the same quest is running. Some Perpetual Quests only last a few days, but others can span months. If a quest that you're already doing arrives again, ignore it.
