<ce>  "Ah, we've got a hero on our hands!
<ce>  I thought I'd have to face the undead.
<ce>  The Fortress of Fhojum is near the coast to the north.
<ce>  Let me mark it on your map... You're looking for an emerald.
<ce>  It should be in the cave section, rather close to the entrance.
<ce>  It'll have a bit of magical charge in it,
<ce>  so you'll know if it's compatible with what I'm planning.
<ce>  Once you have it, come back here.
<ce>  We'll finish off Ganlas after combining the two pieces."

<ce>  This emerald releases some sparks when you pick it up.
<ce>  This must be what the Great Knight wanted.

 Lord Magnessen needs me to go to ___castle_
 in Sentinel region to find a charged emerald. Once I find
 it, he'll be waiting in the palace of Sentinel again.

Message:  1013
<ce> The stench of the dead permeates the Fortress of Fhojum.
