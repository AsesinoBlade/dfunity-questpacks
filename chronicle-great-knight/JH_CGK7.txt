<ce>  The lich's body is so thoroughly battered, several of its bones fly around when it falls.
<ce>  No lich is an easy foe, but this battle feels particularly grueling.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Finally! Is it over?" The Great Knight asks.
<ce>  
<ce>  As if to answer his question, a ghostly form arises from the lich's body.
<ce>  Its glare shows a cold fury.
<ce>  "Fool of a knight! Your time delaying my work will be your undoing.
<ce>  So attuned are you to the dead, that--"
<ce>  
<ce>  The spirit doesn't even finish explaining.
<ce>  It races toward the exhausted Magnessen.
<ce>  He can barely cry out before the ghost flies into him.
<ce>  His long war against the dead in this castle has left him defenseless.
<ce>  He goes stiff, and his eyes roll into the back of his head.
<ce>  They return to focus after a few seconds,
<ce>  but the gaze no longer belongs to the Great Knight.
<ce>  It is Ganlas'.
<ce>  
<ce>  "A new... body... kill... this %ra!!" Ganlas-Magnessen shouts.

<ce>  As powerful as Lord Magnessen is,
<ce>  his strength is augmented by Ganlas' unnatural force.
<ce>  His weapon swings with the fury of a tornado.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Why... won't... you die?!" he yells,
<ce>  his voice wavering between natural and possessed.
<ce>  
<ce>  Finally, Magnessen gets a hold of himself long enough to speak.
<ce>  
<ce>  "%pcf! Tell Gothryd. Get priests. We can't... ARGH!!"
<ce>  Ganlas takes control once more, and the speaking stops.
<ce>  This battle won't end today.

Message:  1012
<ce>  You emerge from Castle Necromoghan, and to your surprise, Magnessen follows you!

%qdt:
 I must hurry to Castle ___dagg_ and enlist the help of King Gothryd,
 to end Ganlas' existence once and for all.

Message:  1016
<ce>  The Great Knight falls, but the process of regeneration has already begun.
