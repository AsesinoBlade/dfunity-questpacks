<ce>  "I can't say I blame you. The undead are a right scourge,
<ce>  and I'll give Fhojum a thrashing before I'm finished with it.
<ce>  The animals are the real problem in Faallem. It's on an island north of here.
<ce>  I'll mark it on your map. You'll be looking for an emerald.
<ce>  There's a particular kind that the enchanters used to use over there,
<ce>  and you'll know which one it is when you touch it.
<ce>  It'll have a bit of magical charge left in it. When you find it,
<ce>  bring it back here and we'll take care of this Ganlas."

<ce>  This relic releases some sparks when you pick it up.
<ce>  This must be what the Great Knight wanted.
