<ce>  Popudax, the court wizard of Daggerfall, puts aside some minor experiments.
<ce>  "Hello! What can I help you with?" he asks.
<ce>  
<ce>  As you relate the story of Ganlas, Popudax looks very troubled.
<ce>  He half-listens and half-thinks while you tell him everything you can.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Oh, this is grievous indeed. I can tell right from the start
<ce>  that this is a deception -- Arkay neither speaks to mortals
<ce>  nor grants them power, much less to raise the dead or become undead.
<ce>  That much, I'm certain of. Madness grips this priest... in whatever form, now.
<ce>  
<ce> "Well, it is clear that an anti-life charm like Magnessen used will be of
<ce>  no worth against Ganlas. Now that your enemy is undead, you'll need something else.
<ce>  It's going to be a bit of a journey, but you need to go to Castle Llugwych,
<ce>  far to the north in Ykalon. The Blades used to store all manner of reagents there.
<ce>  I don't know what state you'll find the castle in, but you need to look for a
<ce>  crystallized daedra heart. It's very rare, which makes me think that only in
<ce>  Llugwych will you find such an item. I can use it for an enchantment you'll need
<ce>  against this Ganlas lich, at no cost. We have to make sure this villain is put down
<ce>  before reaching Daggerfall's royal family, or anyone else we can."

<ce>  This daedra heart is quite old and brittle.
<ce>  This must be the crystallized one that Popudax requested.

Message:  1012
<ce>  "Ah, splendid! Yes, this is probably the best specimen of a crystallized daedra heart
<ce>  I've seen yet. Fine work. Now, I can use this for one of two enchantments.
<ce>  The one will prevent Ganlas from casting any spells.
<ce>  The other will prevent any attempts at self-resurrection. Both will be useful to you,
<ce>  but I can only provide you with one. Which will it be?"
<ce>  
<ce>  (YES: Muting effect; NO: anti-resurrection)

 Ganlas' power is still beyond ours.
 Lord Magnessen will try to stop the lich, while
 I seek the help of Popudax, court wizard of ___dagg_ Castle.

Message:  1016
%qdt:
 Popudax has sent me to ___res_ in Ykalon, to find
 a crystallized daedra heart. Once I deliver it to him, he will
 grant me an enchantment to help me fight Ganlas the lich.
