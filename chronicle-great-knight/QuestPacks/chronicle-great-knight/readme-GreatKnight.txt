I hope you enjoy this short campaign, "The Chronicle of the Great Knight." It requires character level 12, and will start on any new character.

If you wish to attempt it on an existing character, run the following command in the console:

startquest JH_CGK1

Assuming the game locates it properly, it should run, and activate once the character is level 12 or higher.
