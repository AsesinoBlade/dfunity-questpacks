Message:  1043
<ce>  "NOOOOOOO!!" Morgiah shrieks as the king falls.

<ce>  of the monarch's death.

Message:  1050
<ce>  Queen Barenziah's face twists into a condescending grin.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Come back when you learn how to fight, okay child?"

Message:  1051

<ce>  Nulfaga chuckles and smiles kindly.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Now, now, child, not so hasty into battle.

<ce>  
<ce>  (You must be level 12 to duel Nulfaga.)

Message:  1061
<ce>  Do you wish to duel Nulfaga?

Message:  1062
<ce>  A motherly, tender smile crosses her face.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Well then, if you're so insistent, I can't turn you down.
<ce>  But let me cast a spell first, why don't you?"
<ce>  
<ce>  She cackles and changes form into something more worthy
<ce>  of battle. Then she teleports away a short distance
<ce>  to begin the duel.

Message:  1063
<ce>  Nulfaga wheezes and sputters, unable to recover.
<ce>  Slowly, quietly, the life ebbs out of her.
<ce>  Her transformed body lies inert on the floor.

Message:  1070
<ce>  Madame Medora looks you up and down and shakes her head.
<ce>  
<ce>  "No, not now. Killing you would bring me no satisfaction."
<ce>  
<ce>  (You must be level 12 to duel Medora Direnni.)

Message:  1071
<ce>  Do you wish to duel Medora Direnni?

Message:  1072
<ce>  She sighs in a mix of contempt and pity.
<ce>  
<ce>  "If this is the only thing that will satisfy you,
<ce>  I can't keep it from you forever."
<ce>  
<ce>  She casts a spell, changing form before your eyes.
<ce>  The duel has begun.

Message:  1073
<ce>  Lady Direnni shrieks in disbelief.
<ce>  She has been bested in single combat,
<ce>  and her life is at an end.
<ce>  Her eyes close for the last time.

Message:  1080
<ce>  The King of Worms' laughter booms throughout the chamber,
<ce>  and his servants join in.
<ce>  
<ce>  "No, fool! Don't throw your life away!
<ce>  Come back after you've gained strength.
<ce>  A powerful corpse makes for a worthy champion."
<ce>
<ce>  (You must be level 15 to duel the King of Worms.)

Message:  1081
<ce>  Do you wish to duel the King of Worms?

Message:  1082
<ce>  The King of Worms sighs pleasurably.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Ah, it's been too long since I had a good fight!
<ce>  May our battle satisfy us!"
<ce>  
<ce>  He tosses off his robe and casts a spell.
<ce>  Whether this is his natural form or
<ce>  an illusion is just one of his many
<ce>  secrets, never to be divulged.

Message:  1083
<ce>  His form battered beyond function,
<ce>  the King of Worms topples to the floor.
<ce>  He lets out a long, airy chuckle.
<ce>  
<ce>  "A good battle...
<ce>  I will be back, though I know not how long it will take.
<ce>  The King of Worms will never truly die.
<ce>  I concede my honor and the Necromancer's Amulet,
<ce>  if you will take it."
