<ce>          %pcf, I must speak in a low voice
<ce>           regarding this matter. I do not doubt you
<ce>           have seen and destroyed your share of
<ce>           liches in the Iliac Bay. They are usually not a
<ce>           foe to be deeply feared. Well, this day we do
<ce>           have a foe to fear. We need someone to
<ce>           find a lich who has begun to make various
<ce>           undead appear across %crn,
<ce>           ask what precisely the motivation for all
<ce>           this racket is, and see if any solution is
<ce>           forthcoming. We ask you specifically,
<ce>           %pct. Will you do this for us?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>           Then we are doomed.
<ce>          If you will not, who will?

<ce>           Go quickly to ___mondung_. The sorceror has
<ce>           spoken to some who trespass what it considers
<ce>           its lair. Its demands, desires, plans, anything at
<ce>           all that you can bring out of it will be of
<ce>           inestimable worth at this point. Who knows
<ce>           whether it doesn't want to bring down all of
<ce>           %crn into a flaming ruin. We must hear from
<ce>           you in =timer_ days or fewer. And %pcf,
<ce>           please be prepared to run if things go wrong.

<ce>            %oth. You are alive, miraculously.
<ce>           Such overwhelming power! _ancient_
<ce>           is a name I have only read of, but whether
<ce>           it was in guild membership records or in
<ce>           fables of ages past, I cannot remember at
<ce>           this time. We will send you a letter in several
<ce>           weeks' time should we determine a course
<ce>           for future action. In the meantime, please
<ce>           take this reward. %crn donated it
<ce>           specifically for this task, to go directly into
<ce>           your hands. Be ready for our word.
<ce>

<ce>            No turning back, %pcf. Get to
<ce>            ___mondung_. Find some
<ce>           way to get this creature to speak to
<ce>           you and make known its desires. We
<ce>           will wait day and night for your return. 

Message:  1020
<ce>              A voice booms from deep within this
<ce>           place. You can't tell from what direction.
<ce>           
<ce>           "And what will you require of me,
<ce>           %ra? Will I not slay you as I did
<ce>          the imperial mutton who preceded you?"
<ce>           
<ce>          All goes quiet. Now to find the sorceror.

Message:  1021
<ce>            "How utterly pathetic. %ra, I will
<ce>            say this now. Your attempts to stop me
<ce>            will be in vain. Even if you could topple
<ce>            me, within moments I will return to unlife.
<ce>            Cease from this foolish errand. Tell
<ce>            the Mages Guild that _ancient_
<ce>            has come to take what belongs to %g2.
<ce>            Then bow down and take death
<ce>            to be your new master."
<ce>            
<ce>             The lich begins chanting. The words
<ce>              accelerate in intensity and speed.
<ce>               This is the moment to leave.

Message:  1022
<ce>                "What audacity. But here I am."
<ce>               
<ce>               The lich rises to life once more in a
<ce>               new shell. Escape is your only option.

Message:  1023
<ce>               You fight to catch your breath after
<ce>               racing out of the hole. It appears the
<ce>               undead will remain inside for now.
<ce>               After that taste of power, you will
<ce>               have plenty to tell the Mages Guild.

<ce>                "Run. Now."
<ce>               
<ce>               The lich rises to life once more in a
