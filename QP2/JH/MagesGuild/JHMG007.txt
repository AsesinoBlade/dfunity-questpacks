<ce>	%pcf, do you like hearing from the %t? I do not.
<ce>	Most guild members also do not. Our research must
<ce>	 not be interrupted by petty squabbles such as some
<ce>	mere murderer holed up in ___dung_, as is
<ce>	the case at this moment. We received a request this
<ce>	morning to slay one such criminal that the Fighters Guild
<ce>	simply could not locate. Knowing of your combat skill,
<ce>	we wish to bestow this task upon you for the sum
<ce>	of =reward_ gold pieces. Are you ready to teleport?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>	%oth. No one is, apparently.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>	Then we will send you off immediately. Our good
<ce>	_dummy_ will do the incantation.
<ce>	I don't so much care about when you come back,
<ce>	so long as you come back alive. Let the %t
<ce>	take responsibility for these things sooner than
<ce>	 bother us again. Once you're off I can say our work
<ce>	 is in progress. Well then, I won't hold you any further.
<ce>	 Go ahead, _dummy_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>	Oh, %pcf, I am overjoyed at your return. The %t
<ce>	sent a few missives while we waited, and I rejoiced
<ce>	to reply with certain choice words not fit for this guild hall.
<ce>	I feel to reject such petitions in the future, had I the
<ce>	confidence this building would not be closed upon within
<ce>	the week. You have certainly earned your reward. Thank you.

Message:  1010
<ce>	Your work is to find an assassin somewhere in this place.
 
<ce>	(Hint: You may be in a location that's impossible to escape from,)
<ce>	(like inside an enclosed cage or at the bottom of a chute. If so,)
<ce>	(make a save and try the console command "teleport" to get out.)

Message:  1020
<ce>	You have slain the assassin. Now to return to ___qgiver_.
