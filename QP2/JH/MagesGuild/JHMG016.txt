QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> My good %pcf, may I tell you concerning _mage_?
<ce> I love _mage_, and I hate %g2. %g1 has done
<ce> great work for the Mages Guild in the past,
<ce> and therefore should not be abandoned in %g3 hour
<ce> of need. Nevertheless, some experiments simply
<ce> cannot be allowed to proceed, regardless of the pretended
<ce> societal benefit. Will you travel to ___res_
<ce> to shake some sense into %g2?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> What a bother. Are you interested in work, truly?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Our beloved colleague spends %g3 time in
<ce> _res_ of ___res_. I know of the
<ce> subject matter, but I do not speak it aloud, for I know
<ce> some will not recover from the shame of having their
<ce> acts voiced abroad. I merely say %g1 needs to stop, now.
<ce> Please make haste. You will be held responsible for
<ce> _mage_'s life, and I request you do not return
<ce> without %g2. Safe travels, %pct.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> _mage_ falls dead. What will
<ce> you tell _qgiver_ now?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> _mage_! Oh, how I wish to censure
<ce> you right here and now! But I well see you
<ce> need to recover, and then I will give you
<ce> the finest tongue-lashing of the month.
<ce> My joy and my fury fight for control of my
<ce> words. I will see you in a few hours,
<ce> when you have had some rest.
<ce> 
<ce> As for you, %pcf, I bestow on you
<ce> this enchanted _reward_. Finest work
<ce> across the board.

QuestorPostFailure:   [1009]
I remember _mage_. No thanks to you.
<--->
Ah, if only we had _mage_'s help right now. What a shame.

Message:  1010
<ce> _mage_ appears to be in a sort
<ce> of torpor. It's hard to tell whether
<ce> %g1 controls the imp or the imp
<ce> controls %g2.

Message:  1011
<ce> Once the imp falls, _mage_'s eyes open,
<ce> and %g1 looks at you with consternation.
<ce> You begin to explain your task, but before
<ce> you can say much, you hear a noise nearby.
<ce> In its final moments, the imp points at
<ce> at _mage_ a trinket, which crumbles under
<ce> strain of power.

Message:  1015
<ce> _mage_'s face turns pale.
<ce> 
<ce> "That... carried an infectious enchantment.
<ce> I've been diseased and my magicka has departed
<ce> from me. Please, I need to be cured. Help me!
<ce> Cast a spell! A temple will do me no good!"
<ce> 
<ce> %g1 begins sweating and breathing heavily.

Message:  1016
<ce> _mage_ moans, %g3 footsteps faltering.
<--->
<ce> _mage_ nearly stumbles. You help %g2
<ce> regain %g3 footing before continuing.
<--->
<ce> _mage_ spends several seconds in a coughing
<ce> fit before wearily beginning to move again.

Message:  1017
<ce> _mage_ speaks with %g3 eyes closed.
<ce> You understand very little of it.
<--->
<ce> _mage_ speaks with %g3 eyes closed.
<ce> The words are merely whispers.

Message:  1018
<ce> _mage_'s breathing is shallow.
<ce> You help prop %g2 up as you keep moving.
<--->
<ce> _mage_ begins shaking uncontrollably.
<--->
<ce> _mage_ falls to %g3 feet and vomits profusely.
<ce> You help %g2 back up and continue on.

Message:  1020
<ce> A flash of light begins to consume _mage_'s body.
<ce> 
<ce> "It's a trap! I'm being sent to
<ce> ___dung_! Please help!"
<ce> 
<ce> A moment later, %g1 is gone. Some nearby
<ce> scribbles show ___dung_'s location.

Message:  1021
<ce> _mage_ comes into view, apparently
<ce> searching for the exit. With great
<ce> relief %g1 waves to you.
<ce> 
<ce> "Oh, my, thank you for coming here to find me.
<ce> The daft artifact left me without magicka, leaving
<ce> flight as my only option in this cave. Please take
<ce> me to ___qgiver_. I suppose a word with
<ce> _qgiver_ would do me well at this point."

Message:  1022
<ce> Color returns to _mage_'s face, and
<ce> %g1 walks with ordinary vigor.
<ce> 
<ce> "%oth! Never could I have imagined my research
<ce> ending so! Take me to ___qgiver_. I have
<ce> much to say to _qgiver_. Thank you."

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 I have been assigned to bring _mage_
 of ___res_ back to the Mages Guild
 of ___qgiver_. Whatever happens, I will
 be responsible for my colleague's safety.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 _mage_ has been transported to
 ___dung_ by %g3 own trickery.
