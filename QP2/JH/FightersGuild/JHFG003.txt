<ce>              We try to stay out of politics as much as possible, but
<ce>              sometimes the %t force our hand. There's some
<ce>              criminal down in __dungeon_ that the
<ce>              guards have given up on who needs to die. It's
<ce>              paying =reward_ gold. Is that enough for you?
<--->
<ce>           So the Fighters Guild just kills spiders and
<ce>           bears all day, right? Not quite. The %t
<ce>           sometimes tries to get us to pick off some
<ce>           dangerous criminal that they can't catch
<ce>           themselves. It still pays though, in this case
<ce>           =reward_ gold. Does that work for you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                       I'm fine with that. What do we
<ce>                      look like? The Dark Brotherhood?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   You just can't resist, can you %pcf?
<ce>                   Just remember, this isn't murder. We're lawfully
<ce>                   contracted by the %t in this. Get down
<ce>                   to __dungeon_ and back here in
<ce>                   =timer_ days, and I'll have your _reward_ gold here.
<ce>                   
<ce>                   By the way, this one's a ringleader of some band
<ce>                   of some kind, so be ready if things go south.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               Your contract with the Fighters Guild
<ce>               in ___dungeon_ is overdue.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>           Well done. That should keep the %t
<ce>          off our backs for awhile. Here's your gold.

Message:  1020
<ce>                   Your foe lets out a blood-curdling
<ce>                 scream which echoes through the halls.
