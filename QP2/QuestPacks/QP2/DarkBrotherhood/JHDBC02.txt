Message:  1011
<ce>  You're surprised to see a small parchment
<ce>  among your belongings. You reach in to grab it,
<ce>  and a thin layer of foul-smelling powder
<ce>  shoots up into the air, enveloping your face.
<ce>  You take a moment to wipe off the powder,
<ce>  hoping it has no malicious intent.

"To the Dark Brotherhood.
With love,
           The Thieves Guild."
