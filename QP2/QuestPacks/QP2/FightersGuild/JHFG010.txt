<ce>                 ___captive_ is having some problems
<ce>                with venomous critters in its streets.
<ce>                 Wanna go? It's paying =reward_ gold.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>         You one of those types that's allergic to paralysis?
<ce>                    That'd be a problem, I think.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             You just have to kill as many as'll stop 'em
<ce>              from spreading more, however many that is.
<ce>         Don't let yourself get frozen up with their poison,
<ce>            and make sure you don't hit any of the people.
<ce>            Maybe you wanna do it at night. Get it done in
<ce>         =2captive_ days, but you can take your time getting
<ce>            here after that. That's ___captive_, remember.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>        ___captive_ needed its infestation cleared out by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>          Pretty easy, %pcf? Or what did you think? A lot of
<ce>       people hate fighting those critters. The guild couldn't
<ce>      find anyone over there to do it, so it's a good thing you
<ce>                    stepped up. Here's your money.

Message:  1019
<ce>         This extermination contract should just be a matter
<ce>          of walking the streets. You consider waiting until
<ce>               night time to not injure any bystanders.

Message:  1020
<ce>           You've fulfilled the Fighters Guild's contract.
<ce>             _qgiver_ will have your money in ___qgiver_.

Message:  1030
