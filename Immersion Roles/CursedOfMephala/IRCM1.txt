<ce>                   YOUR ROLE IS: CURSED OF MEPHALA
<ce>
<ce>            Your path was chosen before you ever knew it.
<ce>            You were the Cursed of Mephala; life among the
<ce>           civilized people of Tamriel was never your lot.
<ce>     Wherever your name is spoken, it is with disdain and hatred.
<ce>Through means you never understood, infamy follows you like wildfire.
<ce>      Your trial is that of survival -- by any means necessary.
<ce>
<ce>            Nevertheless, you were never left without aid.
<ce>    There is a small chance per day that you find a random potion
<ce>         among your belongings that was not there previously.
<ce>            Very rarely, a new enchanted item would appear
<ce>               for your use. A paltry compensation for
<ce>               living under Mephala's shadow, perhaps,
<ce>             but they've saved your life more than once.
<ce>
<ce>             The question is, how long will you survive?

Message:  1012
<ce>                 As though you were marked by magic,
<ce>       eyes widen and people gasp as you enter the settlement.
<ce>           You are not welcome here, nor ever will you be.
