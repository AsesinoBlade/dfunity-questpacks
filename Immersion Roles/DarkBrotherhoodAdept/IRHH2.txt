<ce>  %pcf! How was the hunt?
<ce>  
<ce>  Oh, is that so? Nothing at all?
<ce>  Not even a scrap of cloth?
<ce>  I find that hard to believe, but
<ce>  I'll take your word for it.
<ce>  Not my style to go bad on a
<ce>  business relationship, you see?
<ce>  No hard feelings. Take your money back.
<ce>  
<ce>  As for where you're going to find this
<ce>  Sapphire Scourge, I haven't the foggiest.
<ce>  I won't waste any more of your time. Best
<ce>  of luck.

<ce>  Now inside ___tav_, it's time to confront
<ce>  _pers_. You assume %g1 will be at
<ce>  _tav_, same as you found %g2.
<ce>  You paid good money for bad information,
<ce>  and intend to get it back.

 I'm searching for an outlaw known
 as the Sapphire Scourge, who has
 a bounty of 3,000 gold pieces.
 My search for clues has been fruitless.
 I paid good money to _pers_ to help me
 find the Scourge, and I deserve a refund.
 Unless %g1 has moved, %g1 should still be
 in _tav_ of ___tav_.

 I'll just need to wait until more
 information comes out, one way or another.
