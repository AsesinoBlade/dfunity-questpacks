Message:  1011
<ce>  YOU ROLE IS: DARK BROTHERHOOD INITIATE
<ce>  
<ce>  You shake your head, getting a hold of your senses.
<ce>  The dead body of your quarry stinks nearby.
<ce>  You made it this far, and now you need to get out.
<ce>  
<ce>  Your efforts to join the Dark Brotherhood have been
<ce>  extensive. Weeks passed by, and all your information
<ce>  gathering seemed to be for naught. Then a note
<ce>  appeared in your pack while you slept one night.
<ce>  It told you to come here and slay a one-eyed
<ce>  thief as a test of your courage. Deep in the depths
<ce>  of this place, you found him and carried it out.
<ce>  You trust the Dark Brotherhood will find you
<ce>  if it's pleased with your work.
<ce>  
<ce>  Now you need to make it out.
<ce>  You were too focused on your search to map your
<ce>  way in, unfortunately. But if you could kill
<ce>  this thief, surely you'll be able to handle
<ce>  anything else here...

<ce>  You step into the settlement. You feel different
<ce>  from when you crossed through here last time.
<ce>  Now you're a murderer, a cold-blooded killer.
<ce>  You have spilt blood, and your fear is gone.
<ce>  
<ce>  Now you wonder what the Dark Brotherhood thinks of you.

 I have slain the Dark Brotherhood's
 apparent quarry, and hope to gain
 their favor. If I have passed their
 test of courage, I'll just have to wait
 until they contact me again.
