Message:  1011
<ce>  "Halt! For your crimes against %crn,
<ce>  I have come to claim your life!
<ce>  Death to the Dark Brotherhood!"
<ce>  
<ce>  A self-proclaimed justiciar wishes to
<ce>  fight you. Some can't wait to die, it seems.
<--->
<ce>  "You! One of those Dark Brotherhood scoundrels,
<ce>  you are! This day will be your last!"
<ce>  
<ce>  Some weakling wishes to end your life.
<ce>  It would be fitting to respond in kind.
<--->
<ce>  "Stop right there, criminal scum!
<ce>  I'm authorized to take your life,
<ce>  by order of the %rt!"
<ce>  
<ce>  You wonder what it would be like to be
<ce>  scared of this miscreant's threats.
<--->
<ce>  "Death to the Dark Brotherhood and all
<ce>  its allies! Hurrah!!"
<ce>  
<ce>  Someone has decided to target you today.
<ce>  Quite unfortunate, really.
<--->
<ce>  "Your murders end here, %ra! Engarde!"
<ce>  
<ce>  Some dumb adventurer is pretending to
<ce>  be a threat today. How quaint.
