<ce>                         YOUR ROLE IS: SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD
<ce>
<ce>             For many, death is an ending. But not to you.
<ce>
<ce>  From your earliest days, you felt impressions from a far away place.
<ce>  You heard talk of people dying, of being gone forever,
<ce>  but the thought is silly. You know that far out there
<ce>  is another abode for those who have passed on...
<ce>  for you have heard them. Just for short moments, but
<ce>  long and real enough to convince anyone.
<ce>  
<ce>  Being in the city too long drowns out your connection
<ce>  to the "far away place." You came here to meditate,
<ce>  to listen, to see if they want to say anything.
<ce>  
<ce>  And then the whisper comes.
<ce>  "Go to ___house_.
<ce>  Find _pers_.
<ce>  My beloved."

Message:  1012
<ce>   Though cities provide safety, you know it'll be harder
<ce>   to hear the spirits here. You have a message to deliver,
<ce>   and passed-on persons to soothe.

Message:  1013
%qdt:
 My meditations have opened my ears.
 One of the deceased asked me to
 visit _pers_ in ___house_.

Message:  1014
<ce>  "Yes, I'm _pers_. What is it?"
<ce>  
<ce>  You're left without words. You don't know what to say.
<ce>  Then you close your eyes. After an awkward pause,
<ce>  the words come. _pers_ gasps and listens to you:
<ce>  
<ce>  "My sweet, please don't blame yourself.
<ce>  The illness that took me couldn't be cured.
<ce>  Please live, live for yourself and
<ce>  our children. I love you."
<ce>  
<ce>  Choking up a little, %g1 nods, wiping a
<ce>  tear from %g3 eye. You decide to go;
<ce>  there's nothing more to be said.
