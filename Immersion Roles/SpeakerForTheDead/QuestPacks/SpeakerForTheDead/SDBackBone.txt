Message:  1011
<ce>  The ability to hear from beyond the grave
<ce>  raises many questions in you.
<ce>  Will there be someone to speak for you,
<ce>  when the time comes? Is there anyone out there
<ce>  with this same gift? And if you abandoned it...
<ce>  would there be consequences?
<ce>  
<ce>  Hopefully you'll never find out.

Message:  1012
<ce>  Communing with the dead has brought you a sense of peace.
<ce>  It's true that many have fallen by your hand,
<ce>  but you sense that there's a greater purpose at work.
<ce>  Thoughts of choice and destiny
<ce>  frequently pass through your mind.
<ce>  Are you an instrument, a mastermind,
<ce>  or merely a stray fragment of chance?
<ce>  Or are there even any answers out there?
<ce>  You have no idea, for the spirits
<ce>  are concerned with their problems, not yours.

--level 4

Message:  1013
<ce>  You're amazed to not have found others with
<ce>  a connection to the afterlife like you have.
<ce>  Or perhaps there have been? You keep your power
<ce>  a closely-guarded secret; wouldn't they, as well?
<ce>  If it's true that your ability is rare, you'll be
<ce>  in demand for quite some time. Perhaps the
<ce>  deceased will lend you aid in time of need, then.
<ce>  Or perhaps not. They seem to only speak when they
<ce>  require help.
<ce>  
<ce>  And if they stop speaking, maybe they've
<ce>  found a more capable vessel for a time.

--level 6

Message:  1014
<ce>  Listening, working, serving...
<ce>  An endless cycle. Your trials continue to build you.
<ce>  Danger has lashed out at you with its many heads,
<ce>  but you have no cause for concern.
<ce>  You're certain that, whatever waits beyond
<ce>  your current life, there'll be something,
<ce>  perhaps someone, on the other end.
<ce>  You hope your reception will be a warm one.
