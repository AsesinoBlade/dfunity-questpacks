<ce>                    "Welcome! How can I help you?"
<ce>
<ce>          You show the priest the rune put under your skin,
<ce>           earning a horrified gasp. You then give a short
<ce>                    version of how it came to be.
<ce>
<ce>             "Oh my! Your captors were no simple band, I
<ce>        can tell that much. This requires great magical power.
<ce>           It had to have been done while you were asleep.
<ce>                      Let me see if I can help."
<ce>
<ce>               Several spells follow, but to no effect.
<ce>                Your heart sinks as you see no change.
<ce>
<ce>           "I'm really sorry, but there's nothing I can do.
<ce>         Thinking about it properly, they must be using some
<ce>          enchanted device of a kind to brand their slaves.
<ce>            Most mages don't deal with this kind of power.
<ce>                 and those who do, won't waste it on
<ce>             a criminal trade. They're greater than that.
<ce>            Once you find the device, break it in pieces,
<ce>            and all brands it created will cease to exist.
<ce>        They're designed with that failsafe to prevent misuse
<ce>                        against their creator.
<ce>
<ce>            "Well, so long as this rune is active they'll
<ce>            come looking for you again. Take any measures
<ce>          necessary to defend yourself, and with luck you'll
<ce>       get some clue to ending this curse. A thousand apologies
<ce>          that I can't help more. %god help you come free."

<ce>                "There's that %ra! The one who escaped!"
<ce>
<ce>         Armed with knives, two thugs rush to apprehend you.

 The slavers put a rune under my skin that tells them
 where I am at all times. Until I get it out, I'm
 continually in danger of being captured again.
 If they come for me, I may get lucky and find
 some way to track them to their home.
 I have to break whatever device they used to
 put the brand on me.
