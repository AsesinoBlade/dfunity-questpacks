<ce>        Emerging from ___dung_, you breathe in the fresh air.
<ce>         With relief you finally accept it: you are no longer
<ce>                   a slave of this merciless band!
<ce>          You can't tell whether the carnage you left behind
<ce>               will be enough to break up their power.
<ce>          Perhaps that's a task for someone else, or a group
<ce>                  of someone elses. But as for you,
<ce>        you are free -- and freedom has never tasted sweeter.

<ce>                  Darkness surrounds you once more.
<ce>        As you steady your footing, you hear a piece of paper
<ce>             under your foot. You reach down and grab it.

Message:  1012
Keep slaves here. Separate hideout for
crew at ___dung_. See map on opposite
side. Squeal and lose your tongue.

Message:  1013
<ce>                  This mage sees the rune implanted
<ce>                     under your skin and hisses,
<ce>
<ce>         "Fool! I'll sooner kill you than let you come free!"

Message:  1014
<ce>            This _trinket_ shimmers with malevolent power.
<ce>              You don't hesitate to smash it to pieces.
<ce>               You look at the rune under your skin and
<ce>        see it rapidly fading. A minute later, no trace of it
<ce>      is left. These cretins will no longer be able to find you.

 I am being hunted by a group of slavers,
 who have put a locating rune under my skin.
 I have in my possession an enchanted diamond,
 which I think will send me to the slavers'
 hideout. I can use it when I'm ready.

%qdt:
 I am being hunted by a group of slavers,
 who have put a locating rune under my skin.
 In the slavers' hideout, I found a map leading
 to their main lair, called ___dung_.
 I'll have to go there and investigate whether
 the means to removing this locating rune is inside.
