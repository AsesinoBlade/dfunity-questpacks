Message:  1011
<ce>             The shock of being stolen from your homeland
<ce>            and nearly forced into labor, or worse, rings
<ce>             fresh in your mind. You are free as yet, but
<ce>              you feel alone, lost, and without friends.

Message:  1012
<ce>             Learning to defend yourself from the slavers
<ce>      has given you confidence. The idyllic life you left behind
<ce>   may never come back, but you can replace it with better things.
<ce>   You're learning to manage your own affairs.

Message:  1013
<ce>         You remember the fear you felt on the slavers' ship,
<ce>      wondering what life held for you next. Now, you no longer
<ce>       feel bound to fate's whim. You're making your own luck,
<ce>           and the thrill of life pushes you ever forward.

Message:  1014
<ce>         You pity whoever would dare try to capture you now.
<ce>      Your skills so far exceed the youthful version of yourself
<ce>       that once fought for survival. Any who dare approach you
<ce>   without your approval will see the grave error they've committed.
