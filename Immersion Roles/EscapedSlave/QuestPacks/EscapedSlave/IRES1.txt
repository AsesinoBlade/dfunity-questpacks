Message:  1011
<ce>                     YOUR ROLE IS: ESCAPED SLAVE
<ce>
<ce>      You enjoyed a simple life in your home town mere days ago.
<ce>          Ignorant of the many dangers that plague Tamriel,
<ce>           you set out for a walk in the nearby wilderness.
<ce>       You heard some shouting nearby and approached the source
<ce>                of it. Someone then cast a spell, and
<ce>       you next remember waking up on a ship with several other
<ce>                captives, surrounded by fierce guards.
<ce>
<ce>          Luckily, a group of vigilantes happened to sail by
<ce>       a short time later. They recognized your captors' vessel
<ce>   and gave battle to free the slaves on board, including yourself.
<ce>         You watched as the slavers fought fiercely to retain
<ce>        their hard-earned prizes. As one mage fell, an unusual
<ce>       gem spilled out of his shirt pocket, clearly enchanted.
<ce>         You scrambled over to grab it and use its magic for
<ce>       your benefit, if possible. One of the criminals shouted,
<ce>                     "No! That %ra's about to--"
<ce>
<ce>      Then the teleportation enchantment fired, sending you far
<ce>       from the battle. As your eyes adjusted to the darkness,
<ce>                you looked around. You can only assume
<ce>        this is the slavers' hideout -- or was, since they'll
<ce>              be looking for a new one now that you were
<ce>                 teleported here. The secret is out.
<ce>
<ce>             They left a small cache of equipment nearby,
<ce>         and you've picked out several things that look to be
<ce>            of use to you. Now you need to find the exit.

Message:  1012
<ce>     You enter this settlement and greet the nearest townsperson.
<ce>          As you tell your story, a crowd gathers, and they
<ce>            give several shocked responses to your plight.
<ce>         Some rummage through their belongings and offer you
<ce>                  money to help you on your journey.
<ce>            You also receive a Potion of Invisibility and
<ce>            an enchanted _item_ that can heal your wounds.
<ce>
<ce>           As the crowd disperses, you hear, "Imagine that!
<ce>                  Slave masters in %crn! How awful!"
