Message:  1011
<ce>  Arriving in ___res_, you call out to a nearby
<ce>  guard and ask about the Sapphire Scourge's victims.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Go to _res_. I'm busy. Don't bother me."
<ce>  He turns away abruptly.
<ce>  It looks like you'll have to find
<ce>  the residence on your own.

 I'm searching for an outlaw known
 as the Sapphire Scourge, who has
 a bounty of 3,000 gold pieces.
 My search for clues has been fruitless.
 The city watch in ___res_ told me to
 look for his or her most recent victims
 in _res_. Perhaps I could
 find a clue within.

Message:  1013
<ce>  The city watch has removed most of the bodies,
<ce>  but the last one remains. You bend down and look
<ce>  for any significant clues to the murder.
<ce>  
<ce>  Suddenly you hear footsteps behind you.
<ce>  "What do you think you're doing?",
<ce>  a strident voice asks.
<ce>  
<ce>  You answer that you're here to investigate
<ce>  the murder, and are cut off. "I don't think you
<ce>  want to do that. Important people get riled up
<ce>  when interlopers are involved, ya hear me?"
<ce>  
<ce>  The hooded figure pulls out a knife and says,
<ce>  "Never shoulda come here, fool %ra."

Message:  1014
<ce>  You have found a map leading to ___dung_.
<ce>  This person must have had something to do
<ce>  with the murders. It would only be logical
<ce>  to go there and see if you find
<ce>  the Sapphire Scourge there.

Message:  1015
<ce>  This is a map leading to a ruin
<ce>  called ___dung_.

Message:  1016
<ce>  Entering ___dung_, you stay
<ce>  alert for any sign of the Sapphire Scourge.
<ce>  This place must be relevant somehow.

 I have learned he or she is connected to
 a ruin called ___dung_. I should
 explore it, if I could find
 the Sapphire Scourge within.

Message:  1019
<ce>  A courier puts a letter in your hands and walks away,
<ce>  too busy to address you.

Message:  1020
To %pcn, the headhunter
<ce>  
  I hear rumors that you're looking for the Sapphire Scourge.
He or she murdered my family. If you can bring me justice,
I hear rumors that the criminal's hideout is called
___res_ of ____res_. Stay safe.
