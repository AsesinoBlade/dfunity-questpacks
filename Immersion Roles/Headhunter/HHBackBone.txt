<ce>  You feel your eyes are sharper,
<ce>  your reflexes faster. You might not

<ce>  -- or at least not yet -- but you're
<ce>  gaining confidence to face any foe
<ce>  that crosses your path.

Message:  1012
<ce>  You're confident. You feel you can defend
<ce>  yourself against any human who opposes you.
<ce>  The world is full of threats, but you're
<ce>  learning to overcome them. You're well
<ce>  on your way to becoming an exceptional mercenary.

--level 4

Message:  1013
<ce>  Your skills continue to improve. You've seen
<ce>  some of the dangers in this world, but you
<ce>  know how to overcome some -- and avoid others.
<ce>  Most of all, you keep a relentless focus.
<ce>  This world has a place for you.

Message:  1014
<ce>  Your hands once shook when you spilled blood.
<ce>  Not anymore. You've learned the ways of the

<ce>  Your mercenary skills prove themselves
<ce>  more and more deadly every day.
