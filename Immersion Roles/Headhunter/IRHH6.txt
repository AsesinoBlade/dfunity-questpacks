<ce>  Greetings. Your name and purpose?
<ce>  Slain the Sapphire Scourge, you say?
<ce>  My word. Where was the hideout?
<ce>  How did you do it? Show me your proof.
<ce>  
<ce>  Interesting. Well, we shall make it known
<ce>  among the people, and they can rest in peace
<ce>  now. There will be many other dangers
<ce>  a skilled bounty hunter like yourself will
<ce>  want to pursue. Ask among the townspeople,
<ce>  and see how you can help them. Many a
<ce>  fighter has grown rich keeping the people safe.
<ce>  Perhaps joining a guild would be to your liking,
<ce>  if you haven't already.
<ce>  
<ce>  Well done, %pcn.
<ce>  
<ce>  (HEADHUNTER QUEST LINE COMPLETE!)
