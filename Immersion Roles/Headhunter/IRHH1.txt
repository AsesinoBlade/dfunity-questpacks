Message:  1011
<ce>  YOU ROLE IS: HEADHUNTER
<ce>  
<ce>  You groggily stand up.
<ce>  You went to sleep yesterday after spending
<ce>  far too many hours here, searching for supposed
<ce>  clues to your quarry. What a waste of your time.
<ce>  
<ce>  You are searching for an outlaw known as
<ce>  the Sapphire Scourge. With a promise of
<ce>  3,000 gold pieces for his or her head,
<ce>  you asked around ___town_ until you were
<ce>  told, on good authority, that he or she
<ce>  calls this place home. Not likely.
<ce>  Or perhaps you were left in the dust.
<ce>  You doubt you can make any more progress here.
<ce>  
<ce>  While you were sleeping, it appears some
<ce>  of the usual residents moved back in.
<ce>  Looks like you'll need to fight your way out.
<ce>  You'll have to take better notes
<ce>  on where the exit is next time.

Message:  1012
<ce>  You enter this settlement and look around, happy
<ce>  to escape the ravages of the wilderness.
<ce>  It isn't ___town_, but it is a respite from the
<ce>  labors of traveling.
