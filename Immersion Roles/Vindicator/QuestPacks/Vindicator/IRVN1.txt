<ce>                         YOUR ROLE IS: VINDICATOR
<ce>
<ce>             Your prey shall not escape.
<ce>
<ce>  Deep in this hole, you search for clues regarding
<ce>  the murderer of ___town_ -- the killer of
<ce>  Old Lysyna's husband. The trail had gone cold and
<ce>  the authorities had given up the chase, but not you.
<ce>  Though Old Lysyna passed away at the start of this
<ce>  year, she was gratified to hear you promise to
<ce>  administer justice. Now her estate hangs in the balance.
<ce>  You will inherit what little belonged to her
<ce>  if you can provide proof of her husband's killer's death.
<ce>  
<ce>  The search has led you to here, where you found 
<ce>  an unusual carving: a circle with
<ce>  three lines scratched into the wall.
<ce>  You don't know what it means, but hopefully your
<ce>  contact in ___town_ will know. This trail must not end here.

<ce>      Being on the trail of a murderer can be frightening.
<ce>   You wonder if any of the people in this settlement
<ce>   could be the one, waiting to kill you or anyone else.
<ce>   Better to get this case solved as soon as possible.

 I am searching for the killer of Old Lysyna's husband,
 with the promise of what remains of her estate
