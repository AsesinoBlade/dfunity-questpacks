<ce>  %pcf. Welcome back. What did you find?
<ce>  
<ce>  Ah, interesting mark. What to you is
<ce>  a circle and three lines is to me
<ce>  a compass with coordinates. Give me a minute.
<ce>  
<ce>  ___city_. That's what the carving translates to.
<ce>  The whole thing is roughly a map of %crn,
<ce>  but I won't explain the science to you.
<ce>  If you're looking for your murderer,
<ce>  head over there first. No telling how long
<ce>  he or she will be there.

Message:  1011
<ce>  You've made it back to ___tav_.
<ce>  The justice agent for this part of
<ce>  ____tav_, _pers_, is probably
<ce>  hanging out in _tav_, which,
<ce>  if you recall correctly, is %di.
<ce>  Finding %g2 will probably save
<ce>  you a lot of trouble.

 I am searching for the killer of Old Lysyna's husband,
 with the promise of what remains of her estate
 once I deliver justice. I found an insignia
 of a circle with three lines carved in
 the killer's hideout. I need to find
 _pers_ in ___tav_ and see
 if %g1 can help to decipher its meaning.
