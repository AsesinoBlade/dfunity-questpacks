Message:  1011
<ce>  Your quest for justice has pulled you out
<ce>  of your own tiny world, and into one filled
<ce>  with peril and mystery. Your adventure
<ce>  has given you new life, and pushes
<ce>  you on relentlessly.

--level 2

Message:  1012
<ce>  Your adventure has honed your skills considerably.
<ce>  The matter of Old Lysyna's husband was only
<ce>  a beginning, the opening of a door.
<ce>  What's behind that door has put you into
<ce>  danger beyond what you ever imagined possible...
<ce>  but you wouldn't trade for your old life.

Message:  1013
<ce>  Mere survival is beneath you now.
<ce>  Your work has become so much more than the
<ce>  search for one assassin. One small decision
<ce>  has led to so much more -- unlocking
<ce>  potential you never knew you had.

--level 6

Message:  1014
<ce>  You still remember Old Lysyna's pitiable face light up
<ce>  when you told her you'd find her husband's killer.
<ce>  She didn't promise much more than her eternal gratitude.
<ce>  Of even greater worth than her estate was the growth
<ce>  you've had, springing from that decision.
<ce>  
<ce>  Maybe someday you'll meet Old Lysyna on the other side.
<ce>  Until then, you just have to keep surviving, fighting,
<ce>  succeeding.
