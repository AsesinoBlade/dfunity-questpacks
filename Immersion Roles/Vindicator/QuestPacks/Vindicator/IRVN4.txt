<ce>  You rummage through the things left to you by Old Lysyna.

Message:  1010
<ce>  You're %pcn? Thank %god.
<ce>  I can't rest. Every moment I fear
<ce>  that my cursed sibling will
<ce>  come to kill me, as with so many others.
<ce>  We speak of insanity, senseless violence.
<ce>  Old Lysyna's husband was killed for no reason at all.
<ce>  You're on the trail of a psychopath!
<ce>  
<ce>  I'll be leaving after our meeting here.
<ce>  Just head to ___dung_.
<ce>  Get this matter over with. I won't have
<ce>  to fear for my life after you do the deed.
<ce>  Oh, had I been braver, the old man would
<ce>  still be alive... and others, too.
<ce>  But now the task is yours.
<ce>  Be strong, %ra. Not like me.

 I am searching for the killer of Old Lysyna's husband,
 with the promise of what remains of her estate
 once I deliver justice.
 A mysterious benefactor, and relative
 of the murderer in the Lysyna case,
 has directed me to ___dung_ in
 the region of ____dung_.
 Apparently there the killer has fled.

Message:  1012
<ce>  "A murderer! That's what you are!
<ce>  Just like me! Just like Lysyna and everyone else!
<ce>  And I'll kill them all! Every last one of them!"
<ce>  
<ce>  Your search for the murderer ends here.
