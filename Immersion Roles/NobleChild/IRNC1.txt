<ce>                       YOU ROLE IS: NOBLE CHILD
<ce>
<ce>         Your father was a noble in the region of ____town_,
<ce>      and your mother's identity is not known. When you came of
<ce>        age, one of the %t's councilors informed you of rumors
<ce>          that your father put your mother to death after a
<ce>        strong disagreement about what your future should be.
<ce>      Your father recently passed, eliminating your only chance
<ce>                 to certify or refute the allegation.
<ce>
<ce>      In recent weeks, an apparent prophetess named _priestess_
<ce>  began to forewarn the coming of a devastating plague to ____town_.
<ce>      Feeling some responsibility for the land in which you hold
<ce>    a stake of nobility, and wanting to establish a new reputation
<ce>        for yourself, you undertook to come to this labyrinth,
<ce>      where she told you a holy tome could be found to alleviate
<ce> or cure the plague. You found it, but lost your way while you crept
<ce>  along the passages. Now you have to find your way out, and deliver
<ce>           the tome to the prophetess in _town_, ___town_.
<ce>
<ce>          You prepared to come here with your _armor2_ that
<ce>             can remove paralysis, and your _armor3_ that
<ce>                  can emit fire bolts at your foes.

Message:  1012
<ce>             You look at this settlement and see so many
<ce>            strangers, people who supported your family in
<ce>          your youth as nobility. You hope you'll be able to
<ce>           avert this plague and save many of their lives.
