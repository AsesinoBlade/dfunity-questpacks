<ce>                   You may have royal blood in you,
<ce>          but your experience so far has put no silver spoon
<ce>           in your mouth. You want to establish your worth
<ce>              in ____place_ by your own merits -- not by
<ce>                         the luck of your birth.

<ce>         Where once your name alone was the key to your fame,
<ce>             your works are starting to garner attention.
<ce>             You wonder if, in the absence of your lineage,
<ce>           you could have reached your current standing
<ce>               just by your very acts. It's hard to say.

<ce>             Some nobles carry the unfortunate reputation
<ce>            of being too soft to govern, too weak to lead.
<ce>               The people of ____place_ would be fools
<ce>          to consider you so. Should some rulership open up,
<ce>           you have little doubt that your merits make you
<ce>                       an obvious candidate.

<ce>      You've far exceeded what is expected of the average noble.
<ce>            Some prefer to live off of the wealth garnered
<ce>             by others' labor, satisfying their own wants
<ce>                in luxurious palaces or safe castles.
<ce>            You are a different kind of noble altogether.
<ce>              Your very name commands respect. You set a
<ce>           standard for a new kind of ruler in ____place_.
