Message:  1011
<ce>            You did not look forward to suffering more of
<ce>        the prophetess's eccentricities. She raises both hands
<ce>                      in the air and proclaims,
<ce>
<ce>         "The tome! %god's holy word for the people of %crn!
<ce>                       Listen closely, child!"
<ce>
<ce>           An awkward silence ensues as she opens the book
<ce>                 and attempts to read from its pages.
<ce>           Many of them are too worn and faded to make out.
<ce>          She makes an uncomfortable humming noise, perhaps
<ce>        to fill the air as she reads. You wish this would end.
<ce>
<ce>               "Ha ha ha ha! Yes, thy journey has been
<ce>               told to me by the great gods themselves!
<ce>      Stay thy tongue and open thy ears, for I have much to say!
<ce>             A witch harboring in ___dung_ shall unleash
<ce>           this curse as vengeance for misdeeds against her
<ce>               ancestors by the %t's great-grandfather,
<ce>         and her rage must be placated! Speak thou with her,
<ce>           and find what it is that shall ease her wrath!"
<ce>
<ce>         You ask if there's anything you could do in advance
<ce>      of the journey to stop the witch, and she shakes her head
<ce>    and starts rambling. She goes on and on about utter nonsense,
<ce>          and you hope for some way to end the conversation.
<ce>    Finally she leans back and starts breathing deeply, exhausted.
<ce>          You take your leave before she gets a second wind.

%qdt:
 The prophetess told me that a witch
 in ___dung_ is the one who will
 bring about the plague on ____dung_.
 If I hope to avert it, I must find
 and speak with her.

Message:  1013
<ce>              You've found the witch. She smirks at you.
<ce>      She seems more in touch with reality than the prophetess.
<ce>
<ce>          "So some %ra hath found me. It mattereth not how.
<ce>            Soon thy people shall be consumed in boils and
<ce>          festering wounds, and nothing shall turn it back.
<ce>            Even should I die, thou couldst not stop it!"
<ce>
<ce>         You declare your identity as a member of ____dung_'s
<ce>        nobility, and, taking a knee, ask what you must do to
<ce>             obtain clemency for the people of the land.
<ce>
<ce>      "Bold words, noble rat. Thou canst not even remember that
<ce>        my grandfather was beaten, flayed, and burned alive by
<ce>      thy people, and for this crime, judgment must be wrought.
<ce>        If thou wouldst hold back my plague from this people,
<ce>         I demand a life for a life. Find _noble_ in the city
<ce>       of ___palace_, and bring him here. I must slay him with
<ce>    my hands, for it was his ancestor who brought about the deed.
<ce>                    I will accept no substitute."
<ce>
<ce>  She ignores any and all reason you try to bring to the discussion.
<ce>    If you wish to save the people of ____dung_, _noble_ must die.

Message:  1014
<ce>         You enter the palace and look around. A servant asks
<ce>     if you need any help, and you tell who you are looking for.
<ce>
<ce>       "_noble_? Oh, you just missed him. He left on a trip to
<ce>          review the prisons across ____dung_. He didn't say
<ce>       when he would return, but I'll tell him to send for you
<ce>                     as soon as I see him again."
<ce>
<ce>        You thank the servant. You'll just have to wait until
<ce>              he returns. You hope it won't be too long.

Message:  1015
<ce>           A knight riding a majestic steed approaches you.
<ce>
<ce>          "Noble %pcn, _noble_ apologizes for not attending
<ce>           to your visit to the palace. He has returned and
<ce>                 greatly desires to hear your words."
<ce>
<ce>              With a mighty salute the knight rides off.

Message:  1016
<ce>             _noble_'s eyes light up at the sight of you.
<ce>         You've only heard his name a few times in the past,
<ce>           and never have met him. He is stiff but cordial.
<ce>
<ce>           "Welcome, welcome. What have we to talk about?"
<ce>
<ce>         You tell of the prophetess and the witch, the coming
<ce>        plague, and the offenses done to the crone's ancestor.
<ce>                         He listens intently.
<ce>
<ce>            "Interesting. I am willing to help, if we may
<ce>             avert a disaster. What is my part in this?"
<ce>
<ce>        Do you tell him the truth, that his life is required?

Message:  1017
<ce>        He begins to shake as you explain the witch's demand.
<ce>          Covering his face with his hands, he first refuses
<ce>             to consider it, and then flies into a rage.
<ce>          Demanding to know whether there is any other way,
<ce>      you make clear that the witch's demand was very specific.
<ce>
<ce>         He stays silent for several minutes. Then he grabs a
<ce>            piece of parchment and begins to write on it.
<ce>       Handing it to a nearby servant, he says, "I am serious."
<ce>   The servant reads it and gasps. "I'll let them know, my liege."
<ce>
<ce>             _noble_ says, "There must be some other way.
<ce>      We will go to see this witch, and I will offer her riches,
<ce>      fame, hospitality, anything. Anything! She must have some
<ce>         susceptibility to her! We will think as we go, %pcf.
<ce>              Lead the way. You know how to get to her."

Message:  1018
<ce>       You tell _noble_ that the witch demands an apology from
<ce>    the closest known descendant of the perpetrator, which is him.
<ce>
<ce>      "Hm! Well, I am not one to go spelunking and so forth, but
<ce>      I can see what is at stake here. You say we can save many
<ce>      lives if I go, do you? Then I am bound by oath to do this.
<ce>        I will think on the matter and provide the fullest and
<ce>     most sincere apology of my life to this woman, and pray that
<ce>           she show mercy to ____dung_. Lead the way, %pcf.
<ce>                You know how to find her, after all."

Message:  1019
<ce>        The witch's eyes burn with fury once she sees _noble_.
<ce>        Before he can even open his mouth, she launches a bolt
<ce>      of lightning at him, burning him severely and sending him
<ce>     to the ground. You step aside as she casts a paralysis spell
<ce>             and starts kicking him in the ribs and neck.
<ce>       Pent-up decades of fury come screeching from her throat
<ce>        as she finishes by torching his body with wild flames.
<ce>        Her breathing is quick and frantic as she studies his
<ce>                     darkened bones on the floor.
<ce>
<ce>         "And yet, it is not enough. I do not feel satisfied.
<ce>                Such a quick death did not become him.
<ce>             I should have kept him here for days and..."
