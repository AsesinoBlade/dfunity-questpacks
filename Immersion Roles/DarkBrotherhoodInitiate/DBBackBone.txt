<ce>  A few days past, doubts found place in your mind.

<ce>  of your employers. You feel a burning desire

<ce>  Murderer. Slayer. Killer. Slaughterer.
<ce>  To some these are ugly words, but to you
<ce>  they are the most beautiful notes in the
<ce>  symphony of your life. You want to hear them
<ce>  again and again. Let the whole world speak
<ce>  of this %ra manslayer. May your name strike
<ce>  terror into their hearts, as it should.
