<ce>               YOUR ROLE IS: DARK BROTHERHOOD INITIATE
<ce>
<ce>         You shake your head, getting a hold of your senses.
<ce>              The dead body of your quarry lies nearby.
<ce>          You made it this far, and now you need to get out.
<ce>
<ce>         Your efforts to join the Dark Brotherhood have been
<ce>         extensive. Weeks passed by, and all your information
<ce>            gathering seemed to be for naught. Then a note
<ce>           appeared in your pack while you slept one night.
<ce>   It told you to kill someone without doubting, without thinking.
<ce>             You snuck into a tavern and used a pillow to
<ce>          take the life from your first target -- silently,
<ce>           smartly. When next you slept, you awoke to find
<ce>         instructions beside your bed to come here and slay a
<ce>     one-eyed thief as a test of your courage. Deep in the depths
<ce>           of this place, you found him and carried it out.
<ce>
<ce>                     Now you need to make it out.
<ce>           You were too focused on your search to map your
<ce>             way in, unfortunately. But if you could kill
<ce>             this thief, surely you'll be able to handle
<ce>                        anything else here...

<ce>           You step into the settlement. You feel different
<ce>            from when you crossed through here last time.
<ce>             You have spilt blood, and your fear is gone.
<ce>
<ce>         You wonder what the Dark Brotherhood thinks of you.

%qdt:
 I have slain the Dark Brotherhood's
 apparent quarry, and hope to gain
 their favor. If I have passed their
 test of courage, I'll need to wait
 until they contact me again.
