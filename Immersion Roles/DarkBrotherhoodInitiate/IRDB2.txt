Message:  1011
<ce>  A figure in a black hood puts a letter
<ce>  into your pack and departs without
<ce>  addressing you.

<ce>  
  Your passion to join the Dark Brotherhood
has reached the ears of persons of importance.
If you feel so inclined, one particular task
would distinguish you from the many knife-wielding
children whom the Brotherhood is gracious enough
to grant membership.
<ce>  
  If this interests you, see _db_
at _dbhouse_ in ___dbhouse_.
Feel no hurry to contact %g2.
That house is %g3 home, and %g1
has no intention of moving.
<ce>
  This letter will cease to be in
three days' time. Record anything of
worth in it before then.

%qdt:
 I have slain the Dark Brotherhood's
 apparent quarry, and hope to gain
 their favor. If I have passed their
 test of courage, I'll need to wait
 until they contact me again. 

Message:  1014
%qdt:
 I have slain the Dark Brotherhood's
 quarry, and have been given

 member thereof. I am directed to

 who lives in _dbhouse_
 ___dbhouse_ of ____dbhouse_
 at my leisure.
