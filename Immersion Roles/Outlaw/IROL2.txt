<ce>                       You step into ___home_,
<ce>                      fearful of being arrested.
<ce>                 You take a quick look around and are
<ce>                 relieved to see that the city guards
<ce>               restrain themselves at the sight of you.
<ce>                Apparently they do believe in the rule
<ce>                of law here after all. You don't know
<ce>              how long it'll last, but you have a chance
<ce>                         to clear your name.

 I have been accused of murder
 in ___home_, of a person named
 Registyr T'laik who apparently
 lived there. I have returned to
 find something that could clear
 my name.

<ce>                             "Hey! %pcf!"
<ce>
<ce>               You're brought up straight by a whisper.
<ce>                 You recognize who it is without even
<ce>                 turning around. At a time like this,
<ce>                      a friend like _friend_ is
<ce>                      worth %g3 weight in gold.
<ce>
<ce>                     "%oth, where have you been?
<ce>                   Come to _home_. We need to talk
<ce>                       about what's going on."
<ce>
<ce>                   _friend_ slips from view, making
<ce>                  sure the guards haven't seen %g2.

 wants me to follow %g2
 to %g3 home, _home_,
 to talk about my accusations.

<ce>                  What a relief to be in the safety
<ce>                     of a friend's home. _friend_
<ce>                    brings you some water and bids
<ce>                           you take a seat.
<ce>
<ce>                "What on Tamriel has happened to you?
<ce>                    People calling you a murderer?
<ce>              Who even is this Registyr person anyway?"
<ce>
<ce>               Of all the things you've done, you know
<ce>               for a fact this can't be pinned on you.
<ce>            You also have no idea who Registyr T'laik is.
<ce>               You recount that you were merely walking
<ce>             to the store, and the guards started chasing
<ce>                   you and accusing you of murder.
<ce>                 You tell _friend_ where you've been
<ce>                   in the meantime, and %g1 shakes
<ce>                          %g3 head in pity.
<ce>
<ce>                      "The sad part is, in %crn
<ce>               your accusations are already being taken
<ce>                into account against you. Don't commit
<ce>                  any more crimes while you're here,
<ce>                 not even vagrancy. I hear talk that
<ce>              they're so suspicious of you, pretty much
<ce>            anything will count as proof of your crimes."
<ce>
<ce>            As %g1 thinks, %g1 remembers, "The official in
<ce>             charge of investigating crimes for this area
<ce>                 is in the palace over at ___palace_.
<ce>                    _noble_, I think the name is.
<ce>                 If you try to talk to %g2, maybe you
<ce>                    can try to find some lead on a
<ce>                        way out of this mess."
<ce>
<ce>                  _friend_ gives you a hug and says,
<ce>               "I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy,
<ce>               much less a best friend. Please be safe.
<ce>         Life is so short. Get this resolved quickly. Okay?"

 I have been accused of murder
 in ___home_, of a person named
 Registyr T'laik who apparently
 lived there. I have returned to
 find something that could clear
 my name. My old friend _friend_
 told me to look for an official
 named _noble_ at the Palace
 of ___palace_, who oversees
 my case. With any luck, %g1
 will give me some chance to
 proof my innocence.

Message:  1017
<ce>               As you enter, a servant asks who you're
<ce>                  looking for. "_noble_? I'm sorry,
<ce>             %g1 is out visiting the neighboring cities.
<ce>             But I'll leave a message for %g2, and we'll
<ce>              send you a letter as soon as %g1 returns."
<ce>
<ce>               It looks like you have no choice but to
<ce>                  occupy your time in something else
<ce>                          until %g1 returns.

Message:  1018
%qdt:
 I tried to find _noble_ at
 the palace of ___palace_,
 but %g1 has gone out to visit
 other cities. I will receive a
 letter when %g1 returns.

Message:  1019
<ce>                  A messenger bearing the colors of
<ce>                     ____palace_ bows before you
<ce>                        and pronounces, "%pcn?
<ce>                     I'm here to inform you that
<ce>                 _noble_ has returned to ___palace_.
<ce>              A sincere apology for the inconvenience."
<ce>
<ce>                        The page then departs.
<ce>         This isn't precisely a letter, but it's good enough.
