Message:  1011
<ce>  The shock of being called a murderer
<ce>  has passed. You feel like you can look
<ce>  people in the eyes now without fear.
<ce>  This whole ordeal has been miserable,
<ce>  and you feel your life has been turned
<ce>  upside-down. But a certain sort of maturity
<ce>  has been beaten into you by your trials.
<ce>  You're starting to see how small you are
<ce>  compared to this huge world -- and it's
<ce>  eye-opening to see how easily a mere
<ce>  accusation can ruin a life.

<ce>  You no longer yearn for those simple, carefree
<ce>  days before your involuntary life of crime began.
<ce>  You're growing quickly from your adversities.
<ce>  You never would have wished this to happen,
<ce>  but working through it has taught you more
<ce>  than the past several years.

Message:  1013
<ce>  It's amazing how much you've grown as a result
<ce>  of one simple accusation. It changed your life
<ce>  forever, and you think it's for the better.
<ce>  You're using this as a springboard for
<ce>  much greater things, and you already see some
<ce>  of them on the horizon.

Message:  1014
<ce>  Looking back, you wonder how your life might
<ce>  have been had you always lived innocent.
<ce>  It had some advantages, to be sure.
<ce>  But would you have gained everything you have now?
<ce>  You have no room left for regret. Your experiences,
<ce>  all you've gained, have paid you back too much
<ce>  to regret anything. You have too much potential
<ce>  to waste time on little nagging thoughts --
<ce>  especially because you never chose this.
<ce>  But you've made good things come
<ce>  from this wild ride.
