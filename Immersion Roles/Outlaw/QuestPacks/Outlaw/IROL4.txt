<ce>       _pers_ begins looking around and bothering the servants.
<ce>
<ce>     "Hello? Yes, I need to speak to your chief justice officer.
<ce>    Yes, it is urgent. I need to clear this innocent %ra's name."
<ce>
<ce>          A few moments later, a harried and angry official
<ce>       emerges to listen. _pers_ clears %g3 throat and begins.
<ce>
<ce>    "First of all, my sincerest thanks to you for giving me time.
<ce>  You must be very busy searching for and punishing true criminals.
<ce>            One of which, I must make clear, is not %pcn.
<ce>       I was involved in a plot to frame %pg2 and abscond with
<ce>        the money left behind by Registyr T'laik while the %t
<ce>      fumbled about trying to find any remaining family members.
<ce>      We were going to use that money to begin a larger network,
<ce>   one that would survive without any dependencies on the cities."
<ce>
<ce>               _pers_ goes into length about the plot,
<ce>             giving details no one would know except the
<ce>          highest officials in the government. The officer's
<ce>     demeanor softens as the story comes out. Putting everything
<ce>         aside, he takes out a book and starts writing notes.
<ce>                            Then he says,
<ce>
<ce>       "It's clear that we let ourselves be persuaded too much
<ce>    by a single witness, no matter how well-crafted the story was.
<ce>          It's a lesson of caution for us in the future, and
<ce>             a grievous mistake to correct now. We do not
<ce>          have any goods to return to you since you were not
<ce>        arrested, but I will emit an edict clearing your name
<ce>      this instant. You should face no more difficulty from the
<ce>              city guard for the privilege of existing.
<ce>         I will warn you, though, that any future crimes will
<ce>               be held to your account. Remember that."
<ce>
<ce>                       _pers_ then bows to you.
<ce>         "I am so sorry we involved you in this. You were not
<ce>          the only victim in our schemes, and I will work to
<ce>          extricate the others from their difficulties, too.
<ce>            With the Marauders against me, my only hope is
<ce>      in the %t's mercy. %god will that my hope be not in vain."
<ce>          _pers_ is then led away in chains, and the officer
<ce>      heads outdoors to tell messengers the truth of the matter.
<ce>
<ce>                        (QUEST LINE COMPLETE!)

Message:  1011
<ce>             This letter seems particularly conspicuous.

Message:  1012
%qdt:
 I have been accused of murdering
 a person named Registyr T'laik.
 A weapons expert led me to a
 cave where I found an abandoned letter.

Ogre:
<ce>
We're making a move. Head to ___res_ and
kill _pers_. We'll split the money
and head to our new hideout.
Hurry up about it.

Message:  1014
%qdt:
 I have found a coded letter talking about
 killing someone named _pers_
 who lives in ___res_. If I can get
 there first, maybe I could make it
 work to my advantage somehow.

Message:  1015
<ce>           Once you enter the residence, you hear startled
<ce>                shouting outside. "Hey! Get a move on!
<ce>              %pcn's already inside the house! Come on!"

Message:  1016
<ce>                You tell _pers_ your name and show %g2
<ce>               the coded letter you found. "Oh my word.
<ce>                   Yes, we must leave immediately.
<ce>                     Please, get us out of here."

Message:  1017
<ce>                Now free of danger, _pers_ speaks up.
<ce>
<ce>           "Thank you very much, %pcn. I am, or was, one of
<ce>           the leading members of the Marauders. Apparently
<ce>        I've been kicked out of the club. I owe you my life."
<ce>
<ce>                You tell _pers_ that you need %g3 help
<ce>                         to clear your name.
<ce>
<ce>            "I can do no less, for you have saved my life.
<ce>             Perhaps the %t will extend leniency to me if
<ce>                I help root out my remaining brethren.
<ce>            I will follow you to the palace of ___palace_.
<ce>           There, I will make everything known to the law,
<ce>             and you will be left in peace, I swear it."

Message:  1018
%qdt:
 I have rescued _pers_, one of the former
 leaders of the Marauder band.
 In exchange, %g1 will testify on my behalf
 to the officials at the _palace_ of ___palace_
 once we arrive there.
