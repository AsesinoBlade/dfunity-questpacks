<ce>                         YOU ROLE IS: OUTLAW
<ce>
<ce>             You feel like you're living in a nightmare.
<ce>
<ce>            Days previous, you were surrounded by hostile
<ce>         guards who, amidst a sea of orders for you to halt,
<ce>              claimed to have evidence that you murdered
<ce>              someone named Registyr T'laik, a resident
<ce>                    of ___town_ where you resided.
<ce>             Resided, most certainly past tense. Now you
<ce>                don't know what to do. If you want to
<ce>              clear your name, you'll have to go back to
<ce>              ___town_, hoping the city watch will have
<ce>         pity on you to let you find some exonerating proof.
<ce>
<ce>           You fled for hours and hours, seeking some kind
<ce>             of refuge from the accusations from without
<ce>               and fear from within. This place looked
<ce>                empty when you entered, but it appears
<ce>             something has stirred up its usual denizens.
<ce>              You'll make sure you keep a map next time
<ce>                       you explore a deep cave.
<ce>
<ce>              If you make no effort at all to clear your
<ce>            name in %crn, your window of opportunity will
<ce>               close. That's another option, of course.
<ce>            Just move on and find another home, somewhere
<ce>                 far from here. The choice is yours.

<ce>              You enter this settlement and look around.
<ce>             You see concerned eyes and guarded stances.
<ce>               Apparently your bad reputation has made
<ce>               it this far. You look forward to a life
<ce>                without a burden of proof against you.

%qdt:
 I have been accused of murder
 in ___town_, of a person named
 Registyr T'laik who apparently
 lived there. I could choose
 whether to flee ____town_ entirely
 or return to the town and
 find something that will
 exonerate me.

Message:  1014
<ce>                  You're ready to move on. ___town_
<ce>                 and ___town_ will have to deal with
<ce>                       their own controversies.
<ce>                You have an entirely new life to lead,
<ce>                and you intend to make the best of it.
