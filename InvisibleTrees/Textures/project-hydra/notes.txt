The opening movie can be replaced.

Uriel explains that the Iliac Bay is on the verge of collapse.
The death of Lysandus, unrest among the nobility, and rumors of ancient power have created chaos.
He offers only partial truths, leaving the player to uncover the full scope of the danger.


The Ghost of Lysandus:

Early in the story, the player witnesses Lysandus' ghost haunting the streets of Daggerfall.
The encounter is dramatic: Lysandus speaks directly to the player, begging for justice and revealing a cryptic warning about the Totem.



First Faction Encounter:

The player's initial investigation leads to an unexpected meeting with a faction leader (Lady Brisienna).
This NPC provides context for the larger stakes of the story. Shows urgency and enthusiasm.


Emperor: Include a letter in the player's journal at the start of the game. It will explain where to meet Brisienna, and insists on trusting her.
    Totem risk: create a super-empire across Tamriel or even the entire world.
    Brisienna: High-ranking Blades member and ambassador to Daggerfall. Disguised as servant of Mynisera. overly helpful near the beginning,
    unusually intelligent. Betrayal near endgame. She's been promised a seat on the Elder Council if she can deliver the Totem to Emperor.


Lysandus: allied to orcs
    King Mogref: agreed to vassal Betony to Daggerfall for protection. Made Sentinel angry and caused the War of Betony.

Gortwog: allied to Lysandus. Shrewd and intelligent but unused to the civilized ways.
    Totem risk: His resentment for the civilized races suggests he'd destroy them all, against his assurances.
    Totem bribe: Powerful Orcish weapon with multiple enchantments

Eadwyre: Extremely wealthy. Will continually bribe the player. Gives very good rewards even for menial things. Give early horse and cart?
    Player won't speak to him directly in the early story, will be given gifts by servants and third parties (Helseth or Woodborne?).
    Never once mentions Helseth or Morgiah in any of his dialogues, and only his wife without using her name.
    Totem risk: Would hand it over to Woodborne, believing it only has limited power, to use it to establish Wayrest's perpetual sovereignty.
    Totem bribe: +200 legal rep in Wayrest and 500,000 gold, presumed to be for a house.

KOW:
    Totem risk: Obvious
    Totem bribe: Infinite tome of training in a magic school

Underking:
    Totem risk: mystery
    Totem bribe: An artifact that casts cure disease, cure poison, and free action, to represent his desire to be healed

Popudax: Knows a lot about the Totem but keeps quiet. Knows Gothryd is extremely dangerous and plots with Woodborne. Can secretly
    give lore hints via letters hidden throughout the region of Daggerfall. Believes he'll be executed if he helps a third party.
    Player can meet him outside the Castle for a tiny exposition, but he will still be afraid.
    Try using proximity trigger on him to show a message?


Step 1: Introducing the Letter from the Emperor
The player's initial inventory contains a letter that:

Establishes their mission to meet Brisienna.
Provides minimal context about why they're needed, emphasizing urgency and the Emperor's trust.
Draft of the Letter:
To [Player's Name],
By the hand of Uriel Septim VII, Emperor of Tamriel

You are to travel to the city of Daggerfall and seek out Lady Brisienna, my trusted ambassador to this volatile region. She will aid you in untangling a grave matter involving the late King Lysandus and the fractured state of the Iliac Bay.

Time is of the essence. Seek her counsel in Daggerfall Castle. The fate of the Bay—and perhaps Tamriel itself—rests upon this mission.

In trust and haste,
Uriel Septim VII



Step 2: First Meeting with Brisienna
Setting: The meeting with Brisienna takes place in a neutral but atmospheric location, such as a hidden chamber in the Daggerfall castle, an abandoned building, or a remote noble estate.

Tone: Brisienna should come across as sharp, competent, and loyal to the Emperor. Her intelligence and charm immediately make her a reliable ally for the player.

Dialogue Ideas:

Initial Information Dump: Brisienna provides a clear summary of the two-pronged plot:
The unrest caused by King Lysandus' haunting.
The rumors of a powerful artifact (the Numidium) resurfacing.
Tactical Advice: She advises the player to:
Investigate Lysandus' murder through Daggerfall's court.
Look into factions rumored to be connected to the Numidium.
Hints at Her Ambition (Subtle Foreshadowing):
She speaks highly of Uriel Septim, almost reverently.
Comments like, “It is a rare honor to serve the Emperor directly” hint at her personal stakes.





Step 3: Brisienna’s Secret Plot
Brisienna’s betrayal must feel organic, with hints scattered throughout the early game. Here’s how to seed it:

Clues to Brisienna’s Motivations:
Her High Ambitions:

In conversations, Brisienna occasionally mentions the Elder Council, perhaps lamenting its corruption or stating how much influence it wields.
She downplays her own ambitions when asked directly, but these comments should later feel suspicious in hindsight.
Interactions with Factions:

When the player deals with factions like Wayrest or Sentinel, they might encounter rumors that Brisienna is pressuring them to align with the Empire.
An NPC could hint that Brisienna’s loyalty to the Emperor might overshadow her loyalty to the player.
Optional Documents:

The player can find correspondence or records implicating Brisienna. For example:
A letter from the Emperor promising her a seat on the Elder Council.
A hidden journal entry where she wrestles with her decision but ultimately commits to betraying the player.


Exposition NPCs: Popudax, Charvek-si, Helseth, all court nobles except K'avar, (anyone missing from Famous Faces?), Karethys



Brisienna's Betrayal:
    By the end of the story, she is berserk and uncontrollable. She arrives with a large number of soldiers. Recall is disabled,
    magicka is reduced. Player can flee or fight the soldiers. In either outcome, Brisienna will disappear forever.
    Player has disobeyed multiple direct orders from her (player is not under her orders, she is just insane with power).
        Orders player to only speak to specific people within the courts of Daggerfall and Wayrest, and not travel to Sentinel.
        If player is a werewolf or vampire, threaten to tell Emperor and ruin your name and future.
    Megalomaniacal, pretends that her orders are the same as the Emperor's.


Lysandus: Was ignorant of the Numidium to the end. He was about to discover it, as a subordinate gave him a letter and bade him
        to read it, about a weapon that could turn the tide of the war. When Lysandus heard about "mass murder" of the enemy
        soldiers, he threw the letter into the bonfire at the military camp. Wayrest soldiers murdered him to prevent him
        from acting on the letter, not knowing he never read it. Gortwog sent a protection contingent to Lysandus by coincidence
        that night but had no intel on the Totem. Once Gothryd became king, Lysandus' subordinates hid all information about
        the Totem, because they assumed Gothryd would use it to enslave his own people.
    
Woodborne: Ironically, one of the player's first contacts via Brisienna. Will accompany the player to a dungeon
        and cast healing/stamina rejuv spells when player gets low. Pretends he can't fight (or maybe he can't?)
        Brisienna knows she can't trust Gothryd and wants a contact in Wayrest, and as Woodborne has been rising in
        power, she eyed him as a possible inroad to the country. Woodborne heard rumors about the Totem and
        went with assassins to kill Lysandus to grant him time to find the Totem first. Was present at Cryngaine Field when
        Lysandus was murdered.
    
Eadwyre: Was a friend to the Emperor a long time ago, but has lax contact in recent years. Sees Woodborne as a worthy heir,
        approves of his marriage to Elysana. Prefers Woodborne over Emperor, not knowing Woodborne is a villain. Would
        not give the totem to Emperor under any circumstances, fears losing his reign to a super-empire.
            After first visit to Wayrest castle, Brisienna becomes incensed. Arrives at the castle and "asks" player to
            accompany her. Exposition visit, she'll be the voice of the player. (Totem stage?)

Helseth: feigns obedience to his stepfather, but doubts his future in this kingdom due to Elysana's existence.
        Really listens to his mother. Serves as a pawn of Barenziah, accompanies the player on a mission.
        Background character, his days are yet to come.

Barenziah: Is only married to Eadwyre for personal security. Has no interest in Wayrest. Is currently
        testing the waters in Wayrest and Morrowind, waiting out the period in Morrowind in case she or Helseth can become monarch there.
        The Queen was considered a loyal vassal throughout the era, and sided against Uriel Septim III and
        Queen Potema during the War of the Red Diamond circa 3E 120. However, circa 3E 391, she went into exile
        due to unrest in her province. Symmachus was killed in a riot, and she was forced to abdicate her throne to
        her uncle Athyn Llethan. Of all her adventures, she is most well-known for going on to help thwart the impostor
        Jagar Tharn and bring about an end to the Imperial Simulacrum by 3E 399. She married King Eadwyre of Wayrest,
        who she had forged a bond with while working to defeat Tharn and free the captive Emperor Uriel Septim VII.
        Background character, her days are behind her.

Cyndassa: Her brother was the page who delivered the Totem letter to Lysandus. She received a large bribe from someone
        to have him killed (not Woodborne, who wanted the secret of the Numidium, not bury it. Brisienna?). Once Lysandus
        was murdered, he fled 

Direnni: Ignorant of the Totem. Angry when she finds out Lysandus squandered it. Key to the Dust of Restful Death, which reveals
        Lysandus' unbroken message. He tells that Woodborne murdered him.

Nulfaga: Driven mad by Lysandus' death. Prophesied that the war would cause ruin to Daggerfall. Caused the storm that wrecked
        the player's ship. (Foresaw thet the player would cause the Numidium to rise?).


Charvek-si: A little absent-minded and ignorant, but useful at her craft. Accompanies the player to a destination? (subterfuge?).
        Could heal the player from a recurring illness/trap. Likely trusts Woodborne.
    

Mantella Crux: As time passes within, send messages from Tamriel via ethereal speech. People's hidden thoughts filter through.
        Some last-minute conversations and revelations. Use a proximity spawning-message-removal method to cause semi-random ordering.

Castellian: Will still die, but his death has to mean something. Accompanies the player to a far-off location, dies upon returning.
        Head of the Wayrest Elder Council. Perhaps shows the player the location of Woodborne Hall and is slain as retribution.
        Since Woodborne is a young noble and a recent addition to the Elder Council, Castellian sees the danger in him.
        Player could be framed for his murder?

Woodborne Hall: Instead of fighting Woodborne, his notes are stored in the two quest locations. Player must retrieve them to find
        out what the Totem is. Contains a cypher to reading a paper deep within Wayrest palace describing the Totem's location in Daggerfall Castle.

Totem:  Stored in Daggerfall vault as an obviously powerful artifact, but Gothryd doesn't know it's the Totem. Popudax withheld this
        knowledge from him.

Totem to Emperor: To avoid excessive branching paths, Brisienna makes player an offer: carry a receptable that will send the Totem
        directly to the Emperor when it is picked up. If refused, go down "Brisienna mad" path. She ambushes player in the Daggerfall vault
        with multple Blades and a powerful trap. Warns player is putting the Empire at risk and committing treason against Emperor.
        She sends a letter several weeks later recalling the player to the Imperial City immediately and to cease and desist on all matters.

The bribes: Accepting anyone's bribe and then not giving the totem to them will incur -200 reputation and permanent negative effects.
        Use global vars for this.
