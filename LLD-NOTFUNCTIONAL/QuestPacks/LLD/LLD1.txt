<ce>        A page, riding on horseback, shouts at no one in particular.
<ce>  
<ce>  "The League of Legendary Dogooders has taken employ in
<ce>  the province of Daggerfall! Speak to Lord Bridwell
<ce>  in Castle Daggerfall within the next 90 days if
<ce>  you wish to spread mighty justice throughout the land!

 A page has announced that something called
 the League of Legendary Dogooders has set
 up in the province of Daggerfall.
 Lord Bridwell is the contact for this
 organization.
 (I will erase this note in 3 days' time.)

<ce>  Yes? Oh, bother. Another for that condemned League of whatever.
<ce>  The King put me in charge of this, and it's been an unceasing headache
<ce>  for the past two weeks. If you want to join this group of crusaders
<ce>  or whatever it is, go find _pers_ at _tavern_ here in town.
<ce>  That's who you need to talk to. I'm no more than a figurehead.
<ce>  
<ce>  Now go on, get out of here.
