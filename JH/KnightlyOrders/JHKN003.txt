QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                My name is _questgiver_. The Order has
<ce>                recently been made aware of a terror of
<ce>                 the night, a vampire of no small renown,
<ce>                lurking in a pitiful hole in %crn.
<ce>                 We are the protectorate of this land and 
<ce>                cannot tolerate such a threat to its people.
<ce>                  Will you answer the call and descend into
<ce>                  the depths of __dung_
<ce>                  to slay this undead monster?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                We could certainly let it consume a few more 
<ce>                   innocents and grow more powerful, yes.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Then be going to __dung_
<ce>                   to rid us of this evil. This is our
<ce>                    duty to %crn, %pcf.
<ce>                    Let your strikes sink deep, that
<ce>                    this creature may know forever
<ce>                     that knights such as ourselves
<ce>                     will not tolerate it here.
<ce>                     The crown expects our report
<ce>                       within =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                       I hear that vampire is yet skulking about
<ce>                          in %crn, %pcf. Have you no shame?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                         Hail the slayer of vampires! Such a
<ce>                          crusade should always merit the
<ce>                          attention of knights. We will
<ce>                          speak of your deeds to inspire
<ce>                          the younger generation to rise
<ce>                            above their own selves.

Message:  1020
