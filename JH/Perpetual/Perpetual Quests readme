The Perpetual Quest system is intended to make the Daggerfall Unity world come alive, spontaneously beginning a variety of quests that reach out to the player.

INSTALLATION
==========

Install the contents of the dfunity-perpetual folder into \DaggerfallUnity_Data\StreamingAssets\Quests. Do not copy the actual folder dfunity-perpetual, only the text files. A new version of _BRISIEN.txt will be replace the ordinary version.

When creating a new character, a prompt will ask whether you wish to begin the Perpetual Quest system. After the system starts, the first quest will arrive in about one month's time.

Occasionally you may get a filler message, such as "You check your bearings momentarily" or "You feel a sudden rush of wind." This means the Perpetual Quest system chose a blank, and will try again in another month's time.

The console command "purgeallquests" will wipe the Perpetual Quest system from the quest list. It will have to be restarted using the console command "startquest JHPINIT".

TO UNINSTALL
==========

Delete all files from JHCG001.txt to the last JHPQ###.txt.
Delete _BRISIEN.txt.
Rename _BRISIEN.OLD to _BRISIEN.txt.
