<ce>          Oh man, %pcf, I'm glad you're here. You're
<ce>          gonna want to see this. I've got this gem in
<ce>          my hand. Looks like an ordinary _miner_, right?
<ce>          It's got this enchantment on it that makes it some
<ce>          kind of murder tool. Just squeeze it for five seconds
<ce>          and watch as summoned monsters start showing up
<ce>          to tear you apart. Straight out of Black Marsh, they
<ce>          told me. Wanna give this thing a shot?
<--->
<ce>          Hey %pcf, check this thing out. One of the guild
<ce>          members picked up this thing for me when she
<ce>          was out in Black Marsh. Look at this _miner_.
<ce>          They call it a death gem, she said. I dunno
<ce>          whether that's an official name or just something
<ce>          we're going with right now, but I wanted to let
<ce>          you give it a shot. What you do is you grab it,
<ce>          squeeze it tight, and then run outside. I made a
<ce>          bet that you're gonna survive it, and I'll give you
<ce>          half if you do it. Deal?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            Aw, don't be such a wimp.
<ce>          I had good money riding on you.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Okay, here it is. Just take it in your
<ce>             hand. Squeeze it hard, start running,
<ce>             and don't let go for five seconds.
<ce>             Then go wild once you're outside.
<ce>             I wanna see the corpses pile up
<ce>             out there. You ready? No turning
<ce>             back now.

<ce>          Hahaha! I can't believe it! You're alive! Those
<ce>          critters are all just magical apparitions or
<ce>          something like that, so they're gonna fade
<ce>          away pretty soon. But I bet they hurt like
<ce>          the real deal! I'm happy to give you half
<ce>          my bet for the show you put on. And promise
<ce>          me you'll do that again, all right? Haven't
<ce>          seen a fight like that since the War of Betony!

<ce>              As you wrap your hand around it,
<ce>              a dim light within grows brighter.
<ce>              The _miner_ vibrates strongly
<ce>              once it starts shining. You pocket
<ce>              it and wait for the effect.
<ce>              
<ce>              "Run! Get outside for some fighting
<ce>              space! It's gonna last an hour!"
<ce>              _questgiver_ shouts.

Message:  1020
<ce>              The _miner_ fades away in a
<ce>              puff of smoke. The show's
<ce>              over now, it would seem.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 I have taken up a dare to use
 a summoning stone which will
 invoke deadly monsters around me.
 The effect will last one hour. I
 should speak to _questgiver_
 once I survive.

Message:  1099
<ce>        Get outside! You're gonna
<ce>          tear up the guild hall!
