<ce>                     DFU DARK BROTHERHOOD QUEST
<ce>          
<ce>          %pct, tell me concerning yourself. Were
<ce>          you to spend a night in a tavern after a long day
<ce>          of merchandising, only to be awakened every six
<ce>          minutes by a loud and drunk barbarian in the main
<ce>          hall, would you feel it proper to approach the
<ce>          Brotherhood and request some natural justice be
<ce>          meted out against the clueless brute? And would
<ce>          you answer a call to deliver such justice?

<ce>          
<ce>          %pcf, I will not mince words. You, I, and every
<ce>          other person in ___questgiver_ hates
<ce>          barbarians. We have a petition to rid ____tavern_
<ce>          of one of them. Will you take advantage of it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>           The Brotherhood rarely makes mistakes, and we
<ce>              hope for your sake you are not one of them.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>       The only correct answer. This barbarian, staying
<ce>       in _tavern_, is actually the target of multiple
<ce>       contracts. If only every day were as lucrative as
<ce>       this. The motives include ceaselessly bragging
<ce>       about romantic conquests, debauching the
<ce>       soon-to-be-married, shouting loudly in the morning
<ce>       hours, and even scratching a beer glass. Apparently
<ce>       the innkeeper has also grown tired of this beast.
<ce>       Serve ___questgiver_ by slaying this
<ce>       brute and returning here within twelve hours.

<ce>              Good, %pct. But let this task cause
<ce>             you no pride. You have yet to do
<ce>            meaningful service in Mephala's favor.

Message:  1023
<ce>            Ha ha ha! Sorry %ra, I'm havin' too
<ce>            much fun 'ere! Maybe a good thrashing
<ce>               will get some o' the beer outta me!

Message:  1024
<ce>            Ha ha ha! This's rich! This %ra
<ce>            is tryin' ta start a fight! Hey fellas,
<ce>            get on over here an' even tha odds!

<ce>            "But how many more... could I have..."
<ce>          
<ce>              The fool's mouth shuts before
<ce>                more stupidity can flow out.
<ce>                  Your work here is done.

Message:  1099
<ce>            Go to _tavern_. I'm
<ce>            here to offer you contracts, not do
<ce>            them for you. You have twelve hours.
