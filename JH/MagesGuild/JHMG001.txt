<ce>                My dear %pcf, do you remember what
<ce>                you were told when we inducted you
<ce>                 into the guild? "Too much power in too
<ce>                  little time has destroyed many." Sadly,
<ce>                  not all our students take heed of that
<ce>                  warning, and we currently have a bit of
<ce>                 a situation on our hands because of it. 
<ce>                  For a copy of a book, we request
<ce>                   your help in culling a student too
<ce>                  well-versed in Illusion magic for
<ce>                            one's own good.

<ce>                    Very well, but what if
<ce>                   you are the next target?

<ce>                   An admirable response, my child.
<ce>                    It seems this student became
<ce>                     hopped up on power after using
<ce>                    a chameleon spell for the first time
<ce>                     and found it just addictive. Then
<ce>                    came experimentation with the
<ce>                     shapeshifting spells, and suddenly
<ce>                     we have reports pouring in of a
<ce>                    tiger wearing robes that kills people.
<ce>                     One of our student's friends knew
<ce>                  that there was this hiding spot of resort,
<ce>                     ___dungeon_ in this same province.
<ce>                   Go there and find our pupil, in whatever
<ce>                   state as may be the case, and end this 
<ce>                   menace for us. You have =timer_ days.


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             The Mages Guild expected you to slay the illusionist by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                         A thousand thanks for saving our
<ce>                        poor pupil from a worse fate. Those
<ce>                          who fail to control power become
<ce>                          slaves to it in time. Have your book.

<ce>                        As the creature's corpse falls, you hear a
<ce>                      groan. This must have been the shapeshifter.

<ce>                        This rogue student is no more.
