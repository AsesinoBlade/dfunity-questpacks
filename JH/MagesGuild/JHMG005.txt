<ce>          
<ce>          Ah, my good %pcf. Do you have a minute?
<ce>          One of our students unearthed this odd little
<ce>          _item_ with some fairly old runes etched on
<ce>          the side. A local expert told us that it says it
<ce>          will activate upon breaking, but the rest of the
<ce>          inscription has faded away. At the very least we
<ce>          are informed it won't erupt in a fireball, such that
<ce>          we wish to risk damaging an ancient artifact
<ce>          for the sake of scientific advancement. Are you
<ce>          brave enough to shatter it and show its effect?

<ce>          Oh, come now, my child. I'm too old to do it myself.

<ce>         "A delightful response. Thank you for that enterprising
<ce>         attitude. That kind of daring will take you far beyond
<ce>         your colleagues, I swear it! Now then, take it in your hands.
<ce>         We weren't sure if you put your hands underneath and
<ce>         twist it to the right or if you grab it by the sides to..."
<ce>         
<ce>         Before _qgiver_ can finish speaking, the frail
<ce>         artifact breaks apart in your hands.

<ce>        My word, %pcf! I had already contacted the Fighters
<ce>        Guild to go looking for you. Of course, they turned me down
<ce>        since we hadn't even the slightest clue where you could
<ce>        be, and they apparently had no desire to start a full
<ce>        search and rescue operation. Well, I suppose I can't
<ce>        blame them. Our students are precious but there's only
<ce>        so much we can do. Now, I am elated to see you before
<ce>        me once more. I expected the matter to be simple, such
<ce>        that I only had a few gold coins set apart. From my personal
<ce>        allowance I will grant you =reward_ gold pieces. I hope
<ce>        not to have to do so very often. But thank you once again.

<ce>        The _item_ has already crumbled to pieces. All you can
<ce>        do now is to get out alive and report back to the Mages Guild.
<ce>      
<ce>      (Hint: You may be in a location that's impossible to escape from,)
<ce>      (like inside an enclosed cage or at the bottom of a chute. If so,)
<ce>      (make a save and try the console command "teleport" to get out.)

%qdt:
 The Mages Guild in ___qgiver_
 asked me to test a runed _item_,
 which teleported me into some labyrinth.
 I should ask for compensation once I return.
