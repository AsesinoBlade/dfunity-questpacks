<ce>                     DFU MERCHANT QUEST
<ce>          
<ce>          %ra, sometimes I trust people in error,
<ce>          and I pray that today is not that day.
<ce>          A friend in confidence has warned me
<ce>           that, tonight, my home is marked for
<ce>          a breaking and entering, an invasion
<ce>           by some traveling thieves. I can't
<ce>            handle this myself, and I need help.
<ce>           The Fighters Guild asked for more
<ce>           than I could afford. For _reward_ gold,
<ce>             will you defend my home this night?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>          Then please say nothing to anyone
<ce>          concerning it. I need no reputation
<ce>               as a coward or a weakling.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 And may a thousand curses of %god be
<ce>               upon you if you are somehow complicit in this,
<ce>                %pcf. I put my life and that of my kindred in
<ce>              your hands. Our home is down the way, called
<ce>                  _res_. I expect something
<ce>                  would occur in the late hours of the night,
<ce>                 probably after midnight. By then even the
<ce>                guards are asleep, they say. Please be there
<ce>                to save us from these foul, demented knaves
<ce>                who put us in jeopardy. 

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               Get lost. We were lucky we didn't need you.

<ce>           _questgiver_ opens the door and inspects
<ce>        the residence. Once %g1 is satisfied, %g1 speaks.
<ce>           
<ce>           "No words can express the thanks I feel for
<ce>            your protection, %pcf. Perhaps your
<ce>            very presence here warded off some of the
<ce>            hesitant among them. Who can say? But
<ce>             I will gladly pay you for this night.
<ce>               Go with the blessings of %god."

Message:  1018
<ce>           You're the %ra _questgiver_
<ce>         sent to keep us safe? Thank you for
<ce>         coming. Stay anywhere you choose.
<--->
<ce>           Please, %ra, stay near the front.
<ce>            We find it hard to trust anyone
<ce>            under these circumstances. Wait
<ce>            there and stand guard for us.

Message:  1020
<ce>             You saved our lives! We will tell it to all of 
<ce>                ___questgiver_, you were our hero!

%qdt:
 _questgiver_, of
 ___questgiver_, contracted me
 to protect _res_
 from burglars tonight. I'm
 told the attack would occur
 in the hours before dawn.

Message:  1099
<ce>          _res_, %pcf.
<ce>          Please relieve my inner tension
<ce>          instead of adding to it further.
